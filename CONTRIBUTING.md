## Filing issues

### Bug report

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:

#### 1. What version of Fleet are you using? 

You can determine the version by viewing the "My account" page in the Fleet UI (pictured below) or by running the `fleetctl version --full` command.

#### 2. What operating system are you using?

#### 3. What did you do?

#### 4. What did you expect to happen?

#### 5. What happened instead?

#### 6. Is this an issue with the Fleet UI?

If the answer is no, you can leave this blank.

If yes, please provide a summary or screenshots of your browser's JavaScript console and your browser's network requests. Why? The information revealed in the browser's console and network requests kickstarts the debugging efforts and thus helps us resolve your issue faster!
