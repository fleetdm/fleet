* Orbit allows configuring osquery startup flags from Fleet, see [#7377](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/issues/7377).

Important note for existing deployments that use Orbit: 
This feature requires Orbit to communicate with Fleet. Orbit uses osquery's enroll secret to authenticate and enroll to Fleet.
On environments where an enroll secret has been revoked, Orbit hosts that were deployed with such secret will fail to enroll to Fleet.
This is not a regression, all existing features should work as expected, but we recommend to fix this issue given that we will be adding
more features to Orbit that will use the new communication channel.

1. To determine which hosts need to be fixed, run the following query: `SELECT * FROM orbit_info WHERE enrolled = false`.
Hosts not running Orbit will fail to execute such query because the table doesn't exist, those can be ignored.
2. Generate Orbit packages with the new enroll secret.
3. Deploy Orbit packages to the hosts returned in (1).
