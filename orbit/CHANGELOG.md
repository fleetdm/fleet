## Orbit 1.19.0 (Dec 22, 2023)

* Add `--host-identifier` option to fleetd to allow enrolling with a random identifier instead of the default behavior that uses the hardware UUID. This allows supporting running fleetd on VMs that have the same UUID and/or serial number.

* At fleetd startup/upgrade, reduced the number of API calls to the server.

* Updated Windows MSI installer to use custom actions to remove Orbit files.

* Allowed configuring osquery startup flags from Fleet, with important notes for existing deployments:

This feature requires Orbit to communicate with Fleet. Orbit uses osquery's enroll secret to authenticate and enroll to Fleet.

On environments where an enroll secret has been revoked, Orbit hosts that were deployed with such secret will fail to enroll to Fleet.

This is not a regression, all existing features should work as expected, but we recommend to fix this issue given that we will be adding more features to Orbit that will use the new communication channel.

1. To determine which hosts need to be fixed, run the following query: `SELECT * FROM orbit_info WHERE enrolled = false`.
Hosts not running Orbit will fail to execute such query because the table doesn't exist, those can be ignored.
2. Generate Orbit packages with the new enroll secret.
3. Deploy Orbit packages to the hosts returned in (1).

* Ensured Orbit re-enrolls when encountering a 401/unauthenticated error when communicating with Fleet server endpoints.

## Orbit 1.1.0 (Aug 19, 2022)
