This utility is not meant for normal users or even sysadmins.
It provides unabstracted access to capabilities which are normally handled for the user automatically when changing the security policy through GUIs such as the Startup Security Utility in macOS Recovery ("recoveryOS").
It is possible to make your system security much weaker and therefore easier to compromise using this tool.
This tool is not to be used in production environments.
It is possible to render your system unbootable with this tool.
It should only be used to understand how the security of Apple Silicon Macs works.
Use at your own risk!
