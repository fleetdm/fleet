# To avoid giving your LLM irrelevant context, this .sideignore file can be used
# to exclude any code that isn't part of what is normally edited.  The format is
# the same as .gitignore. Note that any patterns listed here are ignored *in
# addition* to to what is ignored via .sideignore.
#
# The following is a list of common vendored dependencies or known paths that
# should not be edited, in case they are not already in a .gitignore file.
# Adjust by:
#
# 1. Removing paths for languages/frameworks not relevant to you
# 2. Add any paths specific to your project that get auto-generated but not
#    normally imported, such as mocks etc.
