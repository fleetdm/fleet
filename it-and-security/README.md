- TODO: Consider renaming `lib/` to `platforms/` (or something). If so, then pull out agent options, labels, and icons elsewhere
  - TODO: Regardless consider making labels more of a first class citizen, e.g. a sibling of fleets/ at the top level
  - TODO: Could we eliminate the agent options folder?  Its hierarchical home makes it seem more important than it is for most folks.
- TODO: consider Apple TV and solve android
- TODO: YAML comments throughout
- TODO: Determine how generators will work (platform-first or not?  e.g.:  fleetctl generate ios profile or fleetctl generate profile --ios.  The latter is nice if we can spend the time to make an interactive prompt, but there may not be time for that).
- TODO: Get the ball rolling with generators
- TODO: Get the ball rolling with fleetctl new
- TODO: Get the ball rolling with the equivalent of https://sailsjs.com/documentation/anatomy
