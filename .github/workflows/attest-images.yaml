# This workflow file is a modified version of the goreleaser workflow file which runs during releases. 
# Its purpose is to attest the Docker images produced in https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/actions/runs/13139072879,
# which successfully built the images but failed to upload an attestation due to an error in the attest-build-provenance action.
# Under normal circumstances, the attest-build-provenance action would be run in the goreleaser workflow file.
