# Re-deploy Fleet servers on Render to update to the latest Fleet release.
#
# Render (https://render.com/) is hosting 2 Fleet servers that are used by our gitops repos:
# - https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet-gitops
# - https://gitlab.com/fleetdm/fleet-gitops
#
# The premium server (fleet-gitops-ci-premium) is used by GitHub CI and the free server (fleet-gitops-ci-free) is used by GitLab CI.
# Both servers share a MySQL service (fleet-gitops-ci-mysql).
# - fleet-gitops-ci-premium uses fleet database
# - fleet-gitops-ci-free uses fleet_free database
#
# Both servers share a Redis service (fleet-gitops-ci-redis).
# - fleet-gitops-ci-premium uses database 0 (the default)
# - fleet-gitops-ci-free uses database 1
