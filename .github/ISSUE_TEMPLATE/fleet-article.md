STEPS TO CREATE A NEW FLEET ARTICLE:
1. Create a title:
  a. Start the line with a single (1) # symbol to mark it as an H1 header.
  b. Add a blank line below the title.
2. Add your first sentence or paragraph below the new blank line.
3. Optionally, add paragraph / subsection titles:
  a. Start the paragraph / subsection title line with two (2) ## symbols to mark it as an H2 header.
  b. Add a blank line, then, add more text below your paragraph / subsection headers if used.
4. Optionally, add more stuff:
  a. To use links, see the different style options here: https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#links
  b. To use images or GIFs, see the different style options here: https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#images
  c. To use code blocks, use back ticks, as described here: https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#code-and-syntax-highlighting
5. Correctly populate the article metadata at the bottom of your article body.
6. There are no other style conventions that must be followed - the GitHub markdown specification is available to use as needed.
7. You can use the text below this comment as an article template:
-->

# TITLE (# = H1 header)

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...

## PARAGRAPH / SUBSECTION TITLE (## = H2 header)

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...
