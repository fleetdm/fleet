## Problem

<!-- Describe the problem you're trying to solve. What are you trying to accomplish? 

Example: I want to order a pair of shoes from my food delivery app, which does not show options for stores that don't carry food. -->

## What have you tried?

<!-- Described what actions you have taken in the product today to try and solve this problem. Why didn't that workflow or result work for you? What is missing? 

Example: I searched for shoe stores in my food delivery app, but there were no results available. -->

## Potential solutions

<!-- Propose a solution. What would your ideal workflow look like? You can also attach any screenshots or other visuals that might help convey your meaning. 

Example: My food delivery app should have a new search mapping for other categories of goods that can be delivered like 'clothing' or 'home goods' in the suggested searches menu. -->

## What is the expected workflow as a result of your proposal?

<!-- Example: I search for the shoe store > I click on the pair of shoes in the size and color I want > I am given an estimated delivery time and price > I pay for my order  > A driver picks up the order and delivers it to me > I am able to track the delivery in the same way I would track a food order. -->
