## Code of Conduct

By participating and contributing to this project, you agree to uphold our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Uptycs/kubequery/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Getting Started

Contributions are made to this repo via Issues and Pull Requests (PRs). A few general guidelines that cover both:

- To report security vulnerabilities, please email [kubequery@uptycs.com](mailto:kubequery@uptycs.com).
- Search for existing Issues and PRs before creating your own.

### Issues

Issues should be used to report problems with kubequery, request a new feature, or to discuss potential changes before a PR is created. When you create a new issue, a template will be loaded that will guide you through collecting and providing the information we need to investigate.

If you find an issue that addresses the problem you're having, please add your own reproduction information to the existing issue rather than creating a new one. Adding a [reaction](https://github.blog/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) can also help be indicating to our maintainers that a particular problem is affecting more than just the reporter.

### Pull Requests

PRs to our libraries are always welcome and can be a quick way to get your fix or improvement slated for the next release. In general, PRs should:

- Only fix/add the functionality in question.
- Add unit tests for fixed or changed functionality.
- Address a single concern in the least number of changed lines as possible.
- Include documentation in the repo.
- Be accompanied by a complete Pull Request template (loaded automatically when a PR is created).

For changes that address core functionality or would require breaking changes (e.g. a major release), it's best to open an Issue to discuss your proposal first. This is not required but can save time creating and reviewing changes.

In general, we follow the ["fork-and-pull" Git workflow](https://github.com/susam/gitpr)

1. Fork the repository to your own Github account
2. Clone the project to your machine
3. Create a branch locally with a succinct but descriptive name
4. Commit changes to the branch
5. Following any formatting and testing guidelines specific to this repo
6. Push changes to your fork
7. Open a PR in our repository and follow the PR template so that we can efficiently review the changes.
