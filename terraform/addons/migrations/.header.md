# Migrations addon
This addon enables automatic migrations for Fleet.
Due to limitations in the AWS provider for Terraform, only Linux platforms are supported.
This module uses the local-exec provisioner to call aws-cli to complete migrations.
Due to this, the following commands must be available to the shell:
- aws
