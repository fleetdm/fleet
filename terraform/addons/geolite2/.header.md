# Geoip Terraform module for Fleet

This module adds Geoip data to the Fleet docker image for use with the Fleet Terraform module.

See the [documentation](https://fleetdm.com/docs/configuration/fleet-server-configuration#geoip) for some basic information about what happens under the hood.

You will need to supply a Maxmind license key and a destination docker registry (such as ECR) to hold the new image.

Outputs will be added to the environment variables in Fleet via the `extra_environment_variables` list.
