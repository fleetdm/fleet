# Kinesis Data Stream Logging Destination Setup

## How to use

Below is an example of defining the module to use a single Kinesis Data Stream for all log types (results, status, and audit):
```hcl
module "kinesis" {
  source = "github.com/fleetdm/fleet//terraform/addons/byo-kinesis-logging-destination/target-account"

  fleet_iam_role_arn = "arn:aws:iam::123456789:role/fleet-server-role" # this is the ARN of the IAM (ECS-task) role the fleet servers are running as
  log_destinations = {
    test = {
      name                = "unified-log-stream"
      shard_count         = 0 # shard count only matters if `stream_mode` is `PROVISIONED`
      stream_mode         = "ON_DEMAND" # valid values are `ON_DEMAND` or `PROVISIONED`
      retention_period    = 24 # number of hours you want the data to be retained on the stream
      shard_level_metrics = [] # IncomingBytes IncomingRecords OutgoingBytes OutgoingRecords WriteProvisionedThroughputExceeded ReadProvisionedThroughputExceeded IteratorAgeMilliseconds
    }
  }
}

output "kinesis_logging_destination" {
  value = module.kinesis
}
```

If you desired a Kinesis Data Stream per "topic":
```hcl
module "kinesis" {
   source = "github.com/fleetdm/fleet//terraform/addons/byo-kinesis-logging-destination/target-account"

   fleet_iam_role_arn = "arn:aws:iam::123456789:role/fleet-server-role" # this is the ARN of the IAM (ECS-task) role the fleet servers are running as
   log_destinations = {
      results  = {
         name                = "osquery-results"
         shard_count         = 0 # shard count only matters if `stream_mode` is `PROVISIONED`
         stream_mode         = "ON_DEMAND" # valid values are `ON_DEMAND` or `PROVISIONED`
         retention_period    = 24 # number of hours you want the data to be retained on the stream
         shard_level_metrics = [] # IncomingBytes IncomingRecords OutgoingBytes OutgoingRecords WriteProvisionedThroughputExceeded ReadProvisionedThroughputExceeded IteratorAgeMilliseconds
      }
      status  = {
         name                = "osquery-status"
         shard_count         = 0 # shard count only matters if `stream_mode` is `PROVISIONED`
         stream_mode         = "ON_DEMAND" # valid values are `ON_DEMAND` or `PROVISIONED`
         retention_period    = 24 # number of hours you want the data to be retained on the stream
         shard_level_metrics = [] # IncomingBytes IncomingRecords OutgoingBytes OutgoingRecords WriteProvisionedThroughputExceeded ReadProvisionedThroughputExceeded IteratorAgeMilliseconds
      }
      audit  = {
         name                = "fleet-audit"
         shard_count         = 0 # shard count only matters if `stream_mode` is `PROVISIONED`
         stream_mode         = "ON_DEMAND" # valid values are `ON_DEMAND` or `PROVISIONED`
         retention_period    = 24 # number of hours you want the data to be retained on the stream
         shard_level_metrics = [] # IncomingBytes IncomingRecords OutgoingBytes OutgoingRecords WriteProvisionedThroughputExceeded ReadProvisionedThroughputExceeded IteratorAgeMilliseconds
      }
   }
}

output "kinesis_logging_destination" {
   value = module.kinesis
}
```

1. **Variables:**
    - `fleet_iam_role_arn`: A string variable that holds the ARN of the IAM role which will assume the role defined in this module to gain permissions for writing to the Kinesis Data Streams.
    - `sts_external_id`: An optional string variable that can be used as a unique identifier for the principal assuming the role to assert its identity. Default is an empty string.
    - `log_destinations`: A map variable that contains configurations for multiple Kinesis Data Streams. Each stream configuration includes its name, shard count, stream mode, retention period, and shard-level metrics. Default values are provided for three streams: `osquery_results`, `osquery_status`, and `fleet_audit`.

2. **IAM Role:**
    - `aws_iam_role.fleet_role`: Creates an IAM role with a trust policy that allows the specified IAM role ARN (`fleet_iam_role_arn`) to assume this role. If `sts_external_id` is provided, it adds a condition to the trust policy to require this external ID for the assume role operation.

3. **IAM Policy Documents:**
    - `data.aws_iam_policy_document.assume_role`: Defines the assume role policy for the IAM role. It allows the specified actions (`sts:AssumeRole`) for the specified principals.
    - `data.aws_iam_policy_document.kinesis`: Defines the policy document allowing the IAM role to perform Kinesis and KMS actions. It allows the IAM role to describe, put records into the Kinesis streams (defined in `log_destinations`), and use KMS keys for encryption.

4. **IAM Policy and Attachment:**
    - `aws_iam_policy.fleet_kinesis`: Creates an IAM policy using the defined policy document (`data.aws_iam_policy_document.kinesis`).
    - `aws_iam_role_policy_attachment.fleet_kinesis`: Attaches the created IAM policy to the IAM role (`aws_iam_role.fleet_role`).

5. **KMS Key:**
    - `aws_kms_key.kinesis_key`: Creates a KMS key for encrypting the Kinesis Data Streams.

6. **Kinesis Data Streams:**
    - `aws_kinesis_stream.fleet_log_destination`: Provisions Kinesis Data Streams based on the configurations defined in `log_destinations`. Each stream is created with the specified name, encryption type (using the KMS key), shard-level metrics, shard count (if the stream mode is not "ON_DEMAND"), and stream mode.
