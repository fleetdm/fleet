# S3 File Carving backend

This module creates the necessary IAM role for Fleet to attach when it's running in server mode.

It also exports the `fleet_extra_environment_variables` to configure Fleet server to use S3 as the backing carve results store.

Usage typically looks like:

```terraform
fleet_config = {
  extra_environment_variables = merge(
    local.extra_environment_variables,
    module.carving.fleet_extra_environment_variables 
  )
}
```
