# External Vulnerability Scans addon
This addon creates an additional ECS service that only runs a single task, responsible for vuln processing. It receives
no web traffic. We utilize [current instance checks](https://fleetdm.com/docs/configuration/fleet-server-configuration#current-instance-checks) to make this happen. The advantages of this mechanism:

1. dedicating processing power to vuln processing
    2. ensures task responsible for vuln processing isn't also trying to serve web traffic
2. caching of vulnerability artifacts/dependencies


Usage is simplified by using the output from the fleet byo-ecs module (../terraform/byo-vpc/byo-db/byo-ecs/README.md)
