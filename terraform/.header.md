This module provides a basic Fleet setup. This assumes that you bring nothing to the installation.
If you want to bring your own VPC/database/cache nodes/ECS cluster, then use one of the submodules provided.

The following is the module layout so you can navigate to the module that you want:

* Root module (use this to get a Fleet instance ASAP with minimal setup)
    * BYO-VPC (use this if you want to install Fleet inside an existing VPC)
        * BYO-database (use this if you want to use an existing database and cache node)
            * BYO-ECS (use this if you want to bring your own everything but Fleet ECS services)
