# Solutions Consulting

This page documents processes and responsibilities for Solutions Consulting at Fleet. Solutions Consultants (SCs) play a critical role in our Go-To-Market (GTM) process, working closely with Account Executives (AEs), Account Development Representatives (ADRs), and prospects to understand use cases, provide technical guidance, and help move prospects toward becoming customers.

Solutions Consultants bridge the gap between technical capabilities and business needs, helping prospects understand how Fleet can solve their specific challenges while gathering insights that inform the sales process.

## Role and Responsibilities

Solutions Consultants are responsible for:

- **Prospect outreach**: Reaching out to prospects who are not yet "sales-ready" to understand their needs and provide initial guidance
- **Use case qualification**: Determining whether prospects understand Fleet's capabilities and see how it can solve their specific challenges
- **Technical consultation**: Providing technical guidance and answering questions about Fleet's capabilities, architecture, and implementation
- **Sales enablement**: Working with ADRs and AEs to share insights and context that help move prospects through the sales funnel
- **Customer training**: Developing and delivering training curriculum to help customers succeed with Fleet
- **Prospect enablement**: Helping prospects understand Fleet's value proposition and how it fits their needs

## GTM Group Participation

Solutions Consultants are part of Fleet's GTM groups:

## Outreach Guidelines

When reaching out to prospects or customers, Solutions Consultants follow these guidelines:

- **🐋 "Sales-ready" prospects**: The Account Executive (AE) determines the best way to contact the prospective customer, which is often the Solutions Consultant reaching out to help
- **🌦️ Customers**: Customer Success Managers (CSMs) handle customer outreach
- **🫧 Any other prospects**: Solutions Consultants reach out to prospects who are not yet sales-ready

## Working with ADRs and AEs

Solutions Consultants collaborate closely with Account Development Representatives (ADRs) and Account Executives (AEs):

- **With ADRs**: Solutions Consultants work with ADRs to validate account data, qualify use cases, and coordinate technical outreach with engineers
- **Hand-off to AEs**: When a lead becomes "sales-ready," Solutions Consultants and ADRs share all gathered insights with the Account Executive, providing clear context so the AE can jump into partnership discussions fully informed

## Customer Training and Enablement

Solutions Consultants are responsible for:

- **Customer training curriculum**: Developing training materials and programs to help customers succeed with Fleet
- **Prospect enablement**: Helping prospects understand Fleet's capabilities and value proposition
- **Dogfooding**: Using Fleet internally to ensure we understand the product from a user's perspective
