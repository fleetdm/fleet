# Solutions Consulting

This page documents processes and responsibilities for Solutions Consulting at Fleet. Solutions Consultants (SCs) play a critical role in our Go-To-Market (GTM) process, working closely with Account Executives (AEs), Account Development Representatives (ADRs), and prospects to understand use cases, provide technical guidance, and help move prospects toward becoming customers.

Solutions Consultants bridge the gap between technical capabilities and business needs, helping prospects understand how Fleet can solve their specific challenges while gathering insights that inform the sales process.

## Role and Responsibilities

Solutions Consultants are responsible for:

- **Prospect outreach**: Reaching out to prospects who are not yet "sales-ready" to understand their needs and provide initial guidance
- **Use case qualification**: Determining whether prospects understand Fleet's capabilities and see how it can solve their specific challenges
- **Technical consultation**: Providing technical guidance and answering questions about Fleet's capabilities, architecture, and implementation
- **Sales enablement**: Working with ADRs and AEs to share insights and context that help move prospects through the sales funnel
- **NFR instance management**: Setting up and managing Not For Resale (NFR) instances for qualified prospects and partners
- **GitOps training**: Developing and delivering GitOps training curriculum to help customers succeed with Fleet
- **Prospect enablement**: Helping prospects understand Fleet's value proposition and how it fits their needs

## GTM Group Participation

Solutions Consultants are part of Fleet's GTM groups:

- **🦄 Unicorns group**: Solutions Consultants work with AEs and other team members to provide the best possible customer experience for organizations with 700+ hosts
- See the [🦄 Go-To-Market groups](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/go-to-market-groups#current-gtm-groups) page for current Solutions Consultants and their assignments

## Outreach Guidelines

When reaching out to prospects or customers, Solutions Consultants follow these guidelines:

- **🐋 "Sales-ready" prospects**: The Account Executive (AE) determines the best way to contact the prospective customer, which is often the Solutions Consultant reaching out to help
- **🌦️ Customers**: Customer Success Managers (CSMs) handle customer outreach
- **🫧 Any other prospects**: Solutions Consultants reach out to prospects who are not yet sales-ready

## Working with ADRs and AEs

Solutions Consultants collaborate closely with Account Development Representatives (ADRs) and Account Executives (AEs):

- **With ADRs**: Solutions Consultants work with ADRs to validate account data, qualify use cases, and coordinate technical outreach with engineers
- **Hand-off to AEs**: When a lead becomes "sales-ready," Solutions Consultants and ADRs share all gathered insights with the Account Executive, providing clear context so the AE can jump into partnership discussions fully informed

## NFR (Not For Resale) Instances

Solutions Consultants are responsible for setting up and managing NFR instances for qualified prospects and partners. NFR instances provide temporary access to Fleet's premium features for evaluation, proof-of-concept (POC) work, and partner enablement.

### When to Use NFR Instances

NFR instances should be set up when:

- **Qualified prospects** need hands-on evaluation of Fleet's premium features to make a purchasing decision
- **POC requirements** demand extended access beyond standard trial periods
- **Partners** need access for integration development, training, or demonstration purposes
- **Strategic accounts** require deeper technical evaluation as part of the sales process

NFR instances should **not** be used for:
- General prospect inquiries or initial discovery calls
- Accounts that haven't been qualified or vetted
- Long-term customer support (customers should have their own licensed instances)

### Process for Setting Up NFR Instances

1. **Qualification**: Verify that the prospect or partner meets the criteria for an NFR instance (qualified lead, POC requirement, or partner need)
2. **Request approval**: Coordinate with the Account Executive or appropriate stakeholder to confirm the NFR instance is warranted
3. **Instance setup**: Create the NFR instance with appropriate configuration and feature access
4. **Access provisioning**: Provide access credentials and setup instructions to the prospect or partner
5. **Documentation**: Document the NFR instance details, including:
   - Account name and contact information
   - Purpose and expected duration
   - Associated AE or partner contact
   - Expiration date or review timeline
6. **Ongoing management**: Monitor usage, provide support as needed, and ensure instances are deprovisioned when no longer needed

### Expectations and Best Practices

- **Duration**: NFR instances should have a defined expiration date or review timeline (typically 30-90 days)
- **Communication**: Clearly communicate the purpose, limitations, and timeline of the NFR instance to recipients
- **Follow-up**: Regularly review active NFR instances to ensure they're still needed and being used appropriately
- **Cleanup**: Deprovision NFR instances promptly when they're no longer needed or have expired
- **Documentation**: Maintain accurate records of all NFR instances for tracking and compliance purposes

## GitOps Training

Solutions Consultants are responsible for:

- **GitOps training curriculum**: Developing and delivering GitOps training materials and programs to help customers succeed with Fleet's GitOps capabilities
- **Prospect enablement**: Helping prospects understand Fleet's GitOps features and value proposition
- **Dogfooding**: Using Fleet internally to ensure we understand the product from a user's perspective
