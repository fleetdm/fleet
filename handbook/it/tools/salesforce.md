## What is Salesforce?

Salesforce is Fleet's customer relationship management (CRM) system used for tracking accounts, contacts, opportunities, and sales activities. It serves as the central hub for all customer and prospect data, enabling the sales, marketing, and customer success teams to manage relationships and track revenue.

## Systems it integrates with

Salesforce integrates with several other tools and systems at Fleet:

- **Gong.io** - Conversation intelligence data is synced to Salesforce for call recordings and analytics
- **LinkedIn Sales Navigator** - Contact and account data can be synced between platforms
- **Dripify** - LinkedIn automation data can be imported into Salesforce
- **Clay** - Data enrichment results are synced to Salesforce records
- **Einstein Activity Capture** - Email and calendar sync for sales activities
- **DocuSign** - Contract and order form management
- **Zapier** - Various automation workflows connecting Salesforce to other tools
