## How to get access

2. **For other team members** who need access (e.g., Customer Success, Marketing), [create an issue](https://github.com/fleetdm/confidential/issues/new?assignees=&labels=%3Ahelp-it&projects=&template=1-custom-request.md&title=) with IT. Include:
   - Your role and why you need access
