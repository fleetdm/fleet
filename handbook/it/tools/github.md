# GitHub

## What is GitHub?

GitHub is the version control and collaboration platform used at Fleet for managing code repositories, tracking issues, and coordinating development work. It hosts both public repositories (like the main Fleet codebase) and private repositories (like confidential internal tools and documentation).

## Systems it integrates with

GitHub integrates with numerous systems and tools at Fleet:

- **Slack** - Repository updates, pull requests, and issue notifications
- **CI/CD pipelines** - GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment
- **Figma** - Design files can be linked to GitHub issues
- **Various development tools** - IDE integrations, code review tools, and project management tools
