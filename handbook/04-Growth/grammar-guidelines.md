## Style and grammar guidelines

#### How to write headings & subheadings
Fleet uses sentence case capitalization for all headings across Fleet EE, fleetdm.com, our documentation, and our social media channels.
In sentence case, we write titles as if they were sentences. For example:
> **A**sk questions about your servers, containers, and laptops running **L**inux, **W**indows, and macOS

As we are using sentence case, only the first word of a heading and subheading is capitalized. However, if a word in the sentence would normally be capitalized (e.g. a [proper noun](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/proper-nouns/?&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=11862361094&utm_targetid=dsa-1233402314764&gclid=Cj0KCQjwg7KJBhDyARIsAHrAXaFwpnEyL9qrS4z1PEAgFwh3RXmQ24zmwmowAyOQbHngsI8W_F730aAaArrwEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds),) these words should also be capitalized in the heading.
> Note the capitalization of _“macOS”_ in the example above. Although this is a proper noun, macOS uses its own style guide from Apple, that we adhere to.

#### How use osquery in sentences and headings
Osquery should always be written in lowercase, unless used to start a sentence or heading. For example:
> Open source software, built on osquery.

or
