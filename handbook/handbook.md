# Handbook

## About the handbook

The Fleet handbook is inspired by (and heavily influenced by) the [GitLab team handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/about/).  It shares the same [advantages](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/about/#advantages) and will probably undergo a similar [evolution](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/ceo/#evolution-of-the-handbook).

While this handbook is inspired by [GitLab's handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/), it is nowhere near as complete (yet!)  We will continue to add and update information in this handbook, and gradually migrate information from [Fleet's shared Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1StSOI3HNcsl9VleXxNWfUBT2co7h44OG) as time allows.

### Headings

Headings help readers scan content to easily find what they need. Organize page content using clear headings, specific to the topic they describe.

Keep headings brief and organize them in a logical order:

* H1: Page title
* H2: Main headings
* H3: Subheadings
* H4: Sub-subheadings (headings nested under subheadings)

Try to stay within 3 or 4 heading levels. Complicated documents may use more, but pages with a simpler structure are easier to read.
