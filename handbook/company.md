# Company

## About Fleet

- 💻 building a better way to manage computers


## Culture

### All remote
Fleet Device Management Inc. is an all-remote company, with team members spread across 4 continents and 8 time zones.  The wider team of contributors from [all over the world](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/graphs/contributors) submit patches, bug reports, troubleshooting tips, improvements, and real-world insights to Fleet's open source code base, documentation, website, and company handbook.

### Open source
The majority of the code, documentation, and content we create at Fleet is public and source-available, and we strive to be broadly open and transparent in the way we run the business; as much as confidentiality agreements (and time) allow. We perform better with an audience, and our audience performs better with us.

### Direct responsibility
We use the concept of [directly responsible individuals](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/people#directly-responsible-individuals) (DRIs) to know who is responsible for what.  Every group maintains their own dedicated [handbook page](https://fleetdm.com/handbook), which is kept up to date with accurate, current information, including the group's [kanban board](https://github.com/orgs/fleetdm/projects?type=beta), Slack channels, and recurring tasks ("rituals").

#### Group Slack channels
Every group at Fleet maintains certain Slack channels, which all group members join and keep unmuted.  Everyone else at Fleet is encouraged to mute these channels, using them only as needed.  Each channel has a directly responsible individual who is responsible for keeping up with all new messages, even if they aren't explicitly mentioned (`@`).

## 🌈 Values

Fleet's values are a set of five ideals adopted by everyone on the team.  They describe the culture we are working together to deliver, inside and outside the company:

1. 🔴 Empathy
2. 🟠 Ownership
3. 🟢 Balance
4. 🔵 Objectivity
5. 🟣 Openness

When a new team member joins Fleet, they adopt the values, from day 1.  This way, even as the company grows, everybody knows what to expect from the people they work with.  Having a shared mindset keeps us quick and determined.

### 🔴 Empathy
Empathy leads to better understanding, better communication, and better decisions.  Try to understand what people may be going through, so you can help make it better.

- Think and make customer-first choices.
  <!-- TODO: Figure out what to do with this commented-out bit.  I wrote it, but it's too long.  Maybe just delete it. (mikermcneil, feb 26, 2022)

  > #### Customer first
  > At Fleet, we think about the customer first.  No matter what kind of work you are doing, you serve the customer.
  > 
  > When customers buy Fleet, they trust us to provide the solution for important problems.
  > 
  > Imagine you are the person making the decision to buy Fleet.  Imagine you are responsible for all of your organization's laptops and servers.  Imagine you log in to the product every day.  Imagine you are the developer writing code to integrate with Fleet's REST API.  Imagine you are deploying the server, or running the upgrade scripts.  Imagine you are responsible for keeping your organization's computers secure and running smoothly.
  > 
  > You would rest easier, knowing that everyone who works at Fleet is seeking to deliver the experience they would want for themselves, in your shoes. -->
- Consider your counterpart.
  - For example: keep in mind customers, contributors, colleagues, the other person in your Zoom meeting, the other folks in a Slack channel, the people who use software and APIs you build, the people following the processes you design.
  - Ask questions in a way you would want to be asked.
  - Assume others have positive intent.
  - Be kind.
  - Quickly review pending changes when your review is requested. <!-- TODO: (when you are requested as a reviewer in GitHub, respond quickly.  If pull requests start to stack up, merge conflicts can arise, or the original author can forget, or lose context for why they were making the change.  The more pending changes there are, the harder it is to sort through what needs to be reviewed next.) -->
  - Be punctual.
  - End meetings on time.
- Role play as a user.
  - Don't be afraid to rely on your imagination to understand. <!-- TODO: (When making changes, put yourself in the mindset of the end user. Keep in mind how someone might use the product or process you're building for the first time, or how someone accustomed to the old way might react to a new change.) -->
  - Developers are users too (REST API, fleetctl, docs).
  - Contributor experience matters (but product quality and commitments come first).
  - Bugs cause frustrating experiences and alienate users.
  - Create patches with care (upgrading to new releases of Fleet can be time-consuming for users running self-managed deployments). <!-- TODO: (patch releases are important for improving security, quality, and stability. Cut a patch release if there is a security concern, previously stable features are unusable, or if a new feature advertised in the current release is unusable.  But remember that people have to actually install these updates!) -->
  - Confusing error messages make people feel helpless and can fill them with despair.
  - Error messages deserve to be good (it's worth it to spend time on them).
  - UI help-text and labels deserve to be good (it's worth it to spend time on them).
- Invest in hospitality.
  - "Be a helper."   -Mr. Rogers
  - Think and say [positive things](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2018/06/mr-rogers-neighborhood-talking-to-kids/562352/).
  - Use the `#thanks` channel to show genuine gratitude for other team member's actions.
  - Talking with users and contributors is time well spent.
  - Embrace the excitement of others (it's contagious).
  - Make small talk at the beginning of meetings.
  - Be generous (go above and beyond; for example, the majority of the features Fleet releases [will always be free](https://fleetdm.com/pricing))
  - Apply customer service principles to all users, even if they never buy Fleet.
  - Treat everyone as our guest.
- Better humanity.


### 🟠 Ownership

<!-- TODO: short preamble -->

- Take responsibility.
  - Think like an owner.
  - Follow through on commitments (actions match your words).
  - Own up to your mistakes.
  - Understand why our goals matter.
  - Consider the business impact (fast forward 12 months, consider the total cost of ownership over the eternity of maintenance).
  - Do things that don't scale, sometimes.
- Be responsive.
  - Respond quickly, even if you can't take further action at that exact moment.
  - When you disagree, give your feedback; then agree and commit, or disagree and commit anyway.
  - Favor short calls over long asynchronous back and forth discussions in Slack.
  - Procrastination is a symptom of not knowing what to do next (if you find yourself avoiding reading or responding to a message, schedule a Zoom call with the people you need to figure it out).
- We win or lose together.
  - Think about the big picture, beyond your individual team's goals.
  - Success equals creating value for customers.
  - You're not alone in this (there's a great community of people able and happy to help).
  - Don't be afraid to spend time helping users, customers, and contributors (including colleagues on other teams).
  - Be proactive (ask other contributors how you can help, regardless of who is assigned to what
  - Finish your work all the way before moving to something new (help unblock team members and other contributors to deliver value)  <!-- TODO: (collaborate; help teammates see tasks through to completion) -->
- Take pride in your work.
  - Be efficient (your time is valuable, your work matters, and your focus is a finite resource).
  - You don't need permission to be thoughtful.
  - Reread anything you write for users. <!-- TODO: (Check everything that a user might read for clarity, spelling errors, and to make sure that it provides value.) -->
  - Take your ideas seriously (great ideas come from everyone; write them out and see if they have merit).
  - Think for yourself, from first principles.
  - Use reason (believe in your brain's capacity to evaluate a solution or idea, regardless of how popular it is).
  - You are on a hero's journey (motivate yourself intrinsically with self-talk; even boring tasks are more motivating, fun, and effective when you care).
- Better results.

### 🟢 Balance
Between overthinking and rushing, there is a [golden mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_mean_%28philosophy%29).

- Iterate your work.
  - Work in baby steps. <!-- TODO: (look for ways to make the smallest, minimally viable change. Small changes provide faster feedback, and help us to stay focused on quality) -->
  - Pick low-hanging fruit (deliver value quickly where you can).
  - Think ahead, then make the right decision for now.
  - Look before you leap (when facing a non-trivial problem, get perspective before you dive in; there may be a simpler solution). <!-- TODO: When facing a (non-trivial) problem, take a step back before diving into fixing it - put the problem back in context, think about the actual goal and not just the issue itself, sometimes the obvious solution misses the end goal, sometimes a simpler solution will emerge, or it may just confirm that the fix is the right one and you can go ahead with better confidence -->
- Move quickly.
  - "Everything is in draft."
  - Think fast (balance thoughtfulness and planning with moving quickly).
  - Aim to deliver results daily.
  - Move faster than 90% of the humans you know.
  - Resist gold-plating and avoid [bike-shedding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality).
- Remember, less is more.
  - Focus on fewer tasks at one time.  <!-- TODO: (By focusing on fewer tasks at once, we are able to get more done, and to a higher standard, while feeling more positive about our work in the process.) -->
  - Go with "boring solutions."
  - Finish what you start, or at least throw it away loudly in case someone else wants it.
  - Keep it simple (prioritize simplicity; people crave mental space in design, collaboration, and most areas of life). <!-- reduce cognitive load -->
  - Use fewer words (lots of text equals lots of work).
  - As time allows  ("I would have written a shorter letter, but I did not have the time." -Blaise Pascal).
- Make time for self-care.
  - This helps you bring your best self when communicating with others, making decisions, etc.
  - Consider taking a break or going for a walk.
  - Take time off (it is better to have 100% focus for 80% of the time than it is to have 80% focus for 100% of the time).
  - Think about how to best organize your day/work hours to fit your life and maximize your focus.
- Better focus.


### 🔵 Objectivity
<!-- TODO: write short preamble, like the others --> 

- Be curious.
  - Ask great questions & take the time to truly listen. 
  - Listen intently to feedback and genuinely try to understand (especially constructive criticism).  <!-- TODO: Trust the feedback from counterparts. It’s easy to quickly say “no” or ignore feedback because we’re busy and we often default to our way of thinking is right. Trust that your counterpart is making a good suggestion and give it the time/consideration it deserves. -->
  - See failure as a beginning (it is rare to get things right the first time).
  - Question yourself "why do I think this?".
- Underpromise, overdeliver with your work.
  - Quality results often take longer than we anticipate.
  - Be practical about your limits, and about what's possible with the time and resources we have.
  - Be thorough and don't settle for "the happy path"(every real-world edge case deserves handling).
- Prioritize the truth (reality).
  - Don’t resist being wrong, and always show your work (it's better to make the right decision than it is to be right).
  - Proceed boldly, but change your mind in the face of new evidence ("strong opinions, loosely held").
  - Avoid the sunk cost fallacy (getting attached to something just because you invested time working on it, or came up with it).
  - Be fair to competitors ("may the best product win")
  - Give credit where credit is due (don't show favoritism). <!-- as it breeds resentment, destroys employee morale, and disincentives for good performance. Seek out ways to be fair to everyone - https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#permission-to-play -->
  - Work based on facts, over commentary.
- Speak computer to computers.
  - A lucky fix without understanding does more harm than good.
  - When something isn't working, use the scientific method.
  - This is especially vital when there is a bug, something is slow, or a customer is having a problem.
  - Assume it's your fault.
  - Assume nothing else.
- Better rigor.

### 🟣 Openness
<!-- TODO: preamble -->

- Anyone can contribute.
  - Be outsider-friendly, inclusive, and approachable.
  - [Use small words](http://www.paulgraham.com/writing44.html) so readers understand more easily.
  - Prioritize accessible terminology and simple explanations to provide value to the largest possible audience of users.
  - Avoid acronyms and idioms which might not translate.
  - Welcome contributions to your team's work, from people inside or outside the company.
  - Get comfortable letting others contribute to your domain.
  - Believe in everyone.
- Write down what you're doing.
  - Use the "handbook first" strategy.
  - Writing ideas down makes them real and allows others to read on their own time and  timezone.
  - Never stop consolidating and deduplicating content (gradually, consistently, bit by bit).
- Embrace candor.
  - Don't be afraid of stepping on toes ("short toes").
  - Don't be afraid to speak up (ask questions, be direct, and interrupt).
  - Give pointed and respectful feedback. <!-- (in the same way you would want to receive it) -->
  - Take initiative to improve things (no need to wait [for consensus](https://twitter.com/ryanfalor/status/1182647229414166528?s=12)).
  - Communicate openly (if you think you should send a message to communicate something, send it; but keep comments brief and relevant).
- Be transparent.
  - We're "public by default."
  - We build in the open.
  - Always declassify with care (easier to overlook confidential info when declassifying vs. when changing something that is already public from the get-go).
  - [Open source is forever.](https://twitter.com/mikermcneil/status/1476799587423772674)
- Better collaboration.



## History

### 2014: Origins of osquery
In 2014, our CTO Zach Wasserman, together with [Mike Arpaia](https://twitter.com/mikearpaia/status/1357455391588839424) and the rest of their team at Facebook, created an open source project called [osquery](https://osquery.io).

### 2016: Origins of Fleet v1.0
A few years later, Zach, Mike Arpaia, and [Jason Meller](https://honest.security) founded [Kolide](https://kolide.com) and created Fleet: an open source platform that made it easier and more productive to use osquery in an enterprise setting.

### 2019: The growing community
When Kolide's attention shifted away from Fleet and towards their separate, user-focused SaaS offering, the Fleet community took over maintenance of the open source project. After his time at Kolide, Zach continued as lead maintainer of Fleet.  He spent 2019 consulting and working with the growing open source community to support and extend the capabilities of the Fleet platform.

### 2020: Fleet was incorporated
Zach partnered with our CEO, Mike McNeil, to found a new, independent company: Fleet Device Management Inc.  In November 2020, we [announced](https://medium.com/fleetdm/a-new-fleet-d4096c7de978) the transition and kicked off the logistics of moving the GitHub repository.
