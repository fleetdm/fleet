## About Fleet

Fleet Device Management Inc is an open core company that sells subscriptions that offer more features and support for Fleet and [osquery](https://osquery.io), the leading open source endpoint agent.

We are dedicated to:
- 💍 growing the adoption of osquery (one agent to rule them all)
- 👁️ remaining the freshest, simplest source of truth for every kind of device and OS
- 🧑‍🚀 making IT developer-friendly
- 🪟 open source, as a more private, transparent, and trustworthy future for humanity
- 💻 building a better way to manage computers


## History

### 2014: Origins of osquery
In 2014, our CTO Zach Wasserman, together with [Mike Arpaia](https://twitter.com/mikearpaia/status/1357455391588839424) and the rest of their team at Facebook, created an open source project called [osquery](https://osquery.io).

### 2016: Origins of Fleet v1.0
A few years later, Zach, Mike Arpaia, and [Jason Meller](https://honest.security) founded [Kolide](https://kolide.com) and created Fleet: an open source platform that made it easier and more productive to use osquery in an enterprise setting.

### 2019: The growing community
When Kolide's attention shifted away from Fleet and towards their separate, user-focused SaaS offering, the Fleet community took over maintenance of the open source project. After his time at Kolide, Zach continued as lead maintainer of Fleet.  He spent 2019 consulting and working with the growing open source community to support and extend the capabilities of the Fleet platform.

### 2020: Fleet was incorporated
Zach partnered with our CEO, Mike McNeil, to found a new, independent company: Fleet Device Management Inc.  In November 2020, we [announced](https://medium.com/fleetdm/a-new-fleet-d4096c7de978) the transition and kicked off the logistics of moving the GitHub repository.


## Values

Fleet's values are a set of five ideals adopted by everyone on the team.  They describe the culture we are working together to deliver, inside and outside the company:

1. Empathy
2. Ownership
3. Balance
4. Objectivity
5. Openness

When a new team member joins Fleet, they adopt the values, from day 1.  This way, even as the company grows, everybody knows what to expect from the people they work with.  Having a shared mindset keeps us quick and determined.

### Empathy
Empathy leads to better understanding, better communication, and better decisions.  Try to understand what people may be going through, so you can help make it better.

- be customer first
  <!-- TODO: Figure out what to do with this commented-out bit.  I wrote it, but it's too long.  Maybe just delete it. (mikermcneil, feb 26, 2022)

  > #### Customer first
  > At Fleet, we think about the customer first.  No matter what kind of work you are doing, you serve the customer.
  > 
  > When customers buy Fleet, they trust us to provide the solution for important problems.
  > 
  > Imagine you are the person making the decision to buy Fleet.  Imagine you are responsible for all of your organization's laptops and servers.  Imagine you log in to the product every day.  Imagine you are the developer writing code to integrate with Fleet's REST API.  Imagine you are deploying the server, or running the upgrade scripts.  Imagine you are responsible for keeping your organization's computers secure and running smoothly.
  > 
  > You would rest easier, knowing that everyone who works at Fleet is seeking to deliver the experience they would want for themselves, in your shoes. -->
- consider your counterpart
  - for example: customers, contributors, the other person in your Zoom meeting, the other folks in a Slack channel, the people who use software and APIs you build, the people following the processes you design.
  - ask questions like you would want to be asked
  - assume positive intent
  - be kind
  - be punctual
  - end meetings on time
- role play as a user, contributor, or colleague
  - don't be afraid to rely on your imagination to understand 
  - developers are users too (REST API, fleetctl, docs)
  - contributor experience matters (but product quality and commitments come first)
<!-- TODO: This commented-out one is too hard to explain concisely, probably best to just leave it out
- design by consumer (closeness to the work)-->
- bugs cause frustrating experiences and alienate users
  - confusing error messages make people feel helpless, and can fill them with despair
  - error messages deserve to be good (it's worth it to spend time on them)
  - UI help text and labels deserve to be good (it's worth it to spend time on them)
- simplify
  - prioritize simplicity: people crave mental space (in design, in collaboration)
  - reduce cognitive load via clarity, simpler words, fewer acronyms and idioms that might not translate
  - use fewer words (lots of text == lots of work)
  - but think fast, because i.e. "I would have written a shorter letter, but I did not have the time." -Blaise Pascal
- hospitality
  - "be a helper"   -mr rogers
  - think and say [positive things](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2018/06/mr-rogers-neighborhood-talking-to-kids/562352/)
  - talking with users and contributors is time well spent
  - embrace the excitement of others (it's contagious)
  - make small talk at the beginning of meetings
  - apply customer service principles to all users, even if they never buy Fleet
  - be our guest
- legendary digital/human experience


### Ownership
<!-- TODO: write short preamble, like the others --> 
- take responsibility
  - follow through on commitments (actions match your words)
  - think like an owner
  - be efficient
  - be valuable (consider business impact)
- work on things that matter
  - fast forward 12 months, consider total cost of ownership (the eternity of maintenance)
  - understand why, or tell me why I'm wrong
  - agree, or disagree and commit anyway
- we win or lose together
  - it's worth it to help team members and contributors
  - help unblock users, customers, and other contributors (including colleagues)
  - help team members and contributors get all the way done, delivered all the way to completion
- take yourself seriously
  - on a hero's journey
  - even boring tasks are more motivating, fun, and effective when you care
  - motivate yourself intrinsically with self-talk
  - understand "why?"
  - take your ideas seriously (great ideas come from everyone, write them out and see if they have merit)
- less is more
  - "boring solutions"
  - prefer short calls to long, asynchronous back and forth discussions in Slack
  - avoid bikeshedding
  - bite off what you can chew
  - finish what you start, or at least throw it away loudly in case someone wants it
  - focus on fewer tasks at one time
- legendary results

### Balance
Between overthinking and rushing, there is a [golden mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_mean_%28philosophy%29).

- think, fast (balance thoughtfulness and planning with moving quickly)
- move quickly
  - "everything is in draft"
  - iterate by taking baby steps
  - pick low-hanging fruit (deliver value quickly where you can)
  - avoid gold-plating
  - aim to deliver daily
  - move quicker than 90% of the humans you know
- take pride in your work
  - reread anything you write for users
  - you don't need permission to be thoughtful
  - every real-world edge case deserves handling (be thorough)
- think for yourself
  - from first principles
  - use reason
  - believe in your brain's capacity to evaluate a solution or idea, regardless of how popular it is
- make time for self-care
  - to help you bring your best self when communicating with others, making decisions, etc
  - consider taking a break and going for a walk
  - think about how to best organize your day/work hours to fit your life and maximize your focus
- legendary execution


### Objectivity
<!-- TODO: write short preamble, like the others --> 
- "strong opinions, loosely held"
- be curious
  - listen intently, and genuinely try to understand
  - ask great questions & take the time to truly listen
- be realistic 
  - practical about your limits and what's possible with the time and resources we have
  - question yourself ("why do I think this?")
  - avoid sunk cost fallacy (getting attached to something just because you invested time working on it, or came up with it)
  - be fair to competitors ("may the best product win.")
- prioritize truth (reality)
  - be wrong
  - show your work
  - facts, over commentary
- speak computer to computers
  - when something isn't working, use the scientific method
  - assume it's your fault
  - assume nothing else
- legendary rigour

### Openness
The majority of the code, documentation, and content we create at Fleet is public and source-available, and we strive to be broadly open and transparent in the way we run the business; as much as confidentiality agreements (and time) allow. We perform better with an audience, and our audience performs better with us.

- anyone can contribute
  - be outsider-friendly, inclusive, and approachable
  - [use small words](http://www.paulgraham.com/writing44.html) so readers understand more easily
  - prioritize accessible terminology and simple explanations to provide value to the largest possible audience of users
  - believe in everyone
- candor
  - faster, better decisions
  - don't be afraid to speak up (ask questions, be direct, and interrupt)
- be transparent
  - "public by default"
  - declassify with care (easier to overlook confidential info when declassifying vs. when changing something that is already public from the get-go)
  - open source stewardship: the majority of the features Fleet releases [will be free](https://fleetdm.com/pricing)
  - [open source is forever](https://twitter.com/mikermcneil/status/1476799587423772674)
- legendary transparency
