## Rules of engagement

### Parent / Child Account Ownership Policy:

Owning a parent account does not automatically grant ownership of its subsidiaries. Each subsidiary is treated as its own sellable account. Exceptions (e.g., truly centralized buying) must be explicitly approved by SVP Global Sales.


### Opportunity splits between AEs

- If an opportunity is ~50% through the sales process, ownership of execution should be reassigned to maintain momentum, with a commission split and quota relief reflecting remaining work.

- The originating AE retains credit for work completed; the covering AE earns commission and quota relief proportional to what’s left (e.g., a deal at 75% → 25% split to the support AE).
