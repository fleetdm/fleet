# Growth

As an open-core company, Fleet endeavors to build a community of engaged users, customers, and
contributors.

## Posting on social media as Fleet

Posting to social media should follow a [personable tone](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/brand#communicating-as-fleet) and strive to deliver useful information across our social accounts.

### Topics:

- Fleet the product
- Internal progress
- Highlighting [community contributions](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/community#community-contributions-pull-requests)
- Highlighting Fleet and osquery accomplishments
- Industry news about osquery
- Industry news about device management
- Upcoming events, interviews, and podcasts

### Guidelines:

In keeping with our tone, only use hashtags in line and only when it feels natural. If it feels forced, don’t include any.

Self-promotional tweets are non-ideal tweets.  (Same goes for, to varying degrees, Reddit, HN, Quora, StackOverflow, LinkedIn, Slack, and almost anywhere else.)  See also https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Impact-Equation-Audiobook/B00AR1VFBU

Great brands are [magnanimous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnanimity).

### Scheduling:

Once a post has been drafted, it needs to be delivered to our three main platforms.

- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/fleetctl)
- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/fleetdm/)
- [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/fleetdm)

Log in to [Sprout Social](https://app.sproutsocial.com/publishing/) and use the compose tool to deliver the post to each platform. (credentials in 1Password).


## Promoting blog posts on social media

Once a blog post has been written, approved, and published, please ensure that it has been promoted on social media. Please refer to our [Publishing as Fleet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cmyVgUAqAWKZj1e_Sgt6eY-nNySAYHH3qoEnhQusph0/edit?usp=sharing) guide for more detailed information. 


## Press releases

If we are doing a press release, we are probably pitching it to one or more reporters as an exclusive story if they choose to take it.  Consider not sharing or publicizing any information related to the upcoming press release before the announcement.  See also https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-press-exclusive-and-how-does-it-work

### Press release boilerplate

Fleet gives teams fast, reliable access to data about the production servers, employee laptops, and other devices they manage - no matter the operating system. Users can search for any device data using SQL queries, making it faster to respond to incidents and automate IT. Fleet can also be used to monitor vulnerabilities, battery health, software, and even EDR and MDM tools like Crowdstrike, Munki, Jamf, and Carbon Black, to help confirm that those platforms are working how administrators think they are. Fleet is open-source software. It's easy to get started quickly, easy to deploy, and it even comes with an enterprise-friendly free tier available under the MIT license.

IT and security teams love Fleet because of its flexibility and conventions. Instead of secretly collecting as much data as possible, Fleet defaults to privacy and transparency, capturing only the data your organization needs to meet its compliance, security, and management goals, with clearly-defined, flexible limits.   

That means better privacy. Better device performance. And better data, with less noise.

## Sponsoring events

When reaching out for sponsorships, Fleet's goal is to expose potential hires, contributors, and users to Fleet and osquery.
Track prospective sponsorships in our [partnerships and outreach Google Sheet:](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/107AwHKqFjt7TWItnf8pFknSwwxb_gsp6awB66t7YE_w/edit#gid=2108184225)

Once a relevant sponsorship opportunity and its prospectus are reviewed:
1. Create a new [GitHub issue](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/issues/new).
 
2. Detail the important information of the event, such as date, name of the event, location, and page links to the relevant prospectus. 
 
3. Add the issue to the “Conferences/speaking” column of the [Growth plan project](https://github.com/orgs/fleetdm/projects/21).
 
4. Schedule a meeting with the representatives at the event to discuss pricing and sponsorship tiers.
 
5. Invoices should be received at billing@fleetdm.com and sent to Eric Shaw for approval.
 
6. Eric Shaw (Business Operations) will route signatures required over to Mike McNeil (CEO) with Docusign.
 
7. Once the above steps are completed, use the [Speaking events issue template](https://github.com/fleetdm/confidential/issues/new?assignees=mike-j-thomas&labels=&template=6-speaking-event.md&title=Speaking+event) to prepare speakers and participants for the event.

## Slack channels

These are the Slack channels the growth team maintains. If the channel has a [directly responsible individual](./people.md#directly-resonsible-individuals) (**DRI**), they will be specified. These people are responsible for keeping up with all new messages, even if they aren't mentioned. 

- **#g-growth** **DRI**: Tim Kern
- **#help-swag** **DRI**: Drew Baker
- **#help-promote**

**Who should have these channels unmuted?** Members of this group, everyone else is encouraged to mute them.
