## Responsibilities

The Product Design department is responsible for reviewing and collecting feedback from users, would-be users, and future users, prioritizing changes, designing the changes, and delivering these changes to the engineering team. Product Design prioritizes and shapes all changes involving functionality or usage, including the UI, REST API, command line, and webhooks. 


### Drafting

At Fleet, like [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/#but-wait-isnt-this-waterfall) and [other organizations](https://speakerdeck.com/mikermcneil/i-love-apis), every change to the product's UI gets [wireframed first](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/why-this-way#why-do-we-use-a-wireframe-first-approach).

- Take the top user story that is assigned to you in the "Ready" column of the [drafting board](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/-product-backlog-coming-soon-6192dd66ea2562000faea25c/board) and move it to "In progress."
  
- Create a new file inside the [Fleet product](https://www.figma.com/files/project/17318630/%F0%9F%94%9C%F0%9F%93%A6-Fleet-EE%C2%AE-(product)?fuid=1234929285759903870) Figma project by duplicating "\[TEMPLATE\] Starter file" (pinned to the top of the project).

- The starter file includes 3 predefined pages: Cover, Ready, and Scratchpad.
  -  **Cover.** This page has a component with issue number, issue name, and status fields. There are 3 statuses: Work in progress, Approved, and Released (the main source of truth is still the drafting board).
  -  **Ready.** Use this page to communicate designs reviews and development.
  -  **Scratchpad.** Use this page for work in progress and design that might be useful in the future.

- If the story requires API or YAML file changes, open a pull request to the reference docs release branch (e.g. `docs-v4.58.0`) with the proposed design. Mark the PR ready for review as soon as it's ready for feedback from the [API design DRI](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/communications#directly-responsible-individuals-dris).

- Add links to the user story as specified in the [issue template](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/issues/new?template=story.md).

- Draft changes to the Fleet product that solve the problem specified in the story. Constantly place yourself in the shoes of a user while drafting changes. Place these drafts in the appropriate Figma file in Fleet product project.

- Use dev notes (component available in our library) to highlight important information to engineers and other teammates.

- To help contributors find Figma wireframes for the area of the UI you're making changes to, add page names (ex. Host details page) to the user story's title and/or description.

- Be intentional about changes to design components (e.g. button border-radius or modal width) because these are expensive. They'll require code changes and QA in multiple parts of the product. Propose changes to a design component as part of an already-prioritized user story instead of [making a new request](#making-a-request) in üéÅüó£ Feature Fest.

- Reach out to sales, customer success, and demand for a business perspective.

- Engage engineering to gain insight into technical costs and feasibility.

- If the story has a requester and the title and/or description change during drafting (scope change), notify the requester. The customer DRI should confirm that the updated scope still meets the requester's needs.

>**Questions, missing information, and notes:** Take a screenshot of the area in Figma and add a comment in the story's GitHub issue. Figma does have a commenting system, but it is not easy to search for outstanding concerns and is therefore not preferred. Also, commenting in Figma, sends all contributors email notifications.
>
>For external contributors: please consider opening an issue with reference screenshots if you have a Figma related question you need to resolve.

### Prepare for design review

1. Link to your draft in the user story issue.
2. Add the user story to the agenda for the [design review](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/product-groups#design-reviews) meeting.
3. Attend design review or schedule an ad-hoc design review if you need to move faster.

> As drafting occurs, inevitably, the requirements will change. The main description of the issue should be the single source of truth for the problem to be solved and the required outcome. The product manager is responsible for keeping the main description of the issue up-to-date. Comments and other items can and should be kept in the issue for historical record-keeping.


### Ensure story drafting is complete

Once a story is approved in [design review](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/product-groups#design-reviews), the Product Designer is responsible for moving the user story to the "Ready to spec" column, assigning the appropriate Engineering Manager (EM), adding a product group label, and changing the status on the cover page of the relevant Figma file to "Approved".

The EM is responsible for moving the user story to the "Specified" and "Estimated" columns.

Before assigning an EM, double-check that the "Product" section of the user story [checklist](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/issues/new?assignees=&labels=story&projects=&template=story.md&title=) is complete (no TODOs). 

Once a bug is approved in design review, The Product Designer is responsible for moving the bug to the appropriate release board.


### Revise a draft currently in development

Expedited drafting is the revision of drafted changes currently being developed by
the engineering team. Expedited drafting aims to quickly adapt to unknown edge cases and
changing specifications while ensuring that Fleet meets our brand and quality guidelines. 

You'll know it's time for expedited drafting when:
- The team discovers that a drafted user story is missing crucial information that prevents contributors from continuing the development task.
- A user story is taking more effort than was originally estimated, and Product Manager wants to find ways to cut aspects of planned functionality in order to still ship the improvement in the currently scheduled release.
- A user story on the drafting board won't reach "Ready for spec" by the last estimation session in the current sprint and cannot wait until the next sprint. This can also happen when we decide to bring a user story in mid-sprint.

What happens during expedited drafting?
1. If the story has a requester, notify the requester. The customer DRI should confirm that the updated scope still meets the requester's need.
2. If the user story wasn't "Ready for spec" by the last estimation session, the product group's engineering manager (EM), [release DRI](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/communications#directly-responsible-individuals-dris), and Head of Product Design are notified in the `#g-mdm` or `#g-endpoint-ops` Slack channel. Decision to allow the user story to make it into the sprint is up to the release DRI.
3. If the user story is already in the sprint, the EM, release DRI, and Head of Product Design are notified in the `#g-mdm` or `#g-endpoint-ops` channel. If there are significant changes to the requirements, then the user story might be pushed to the next sprint. Decision is up to the release DRI.
4. If the release DRI decides the user story will be worked on this sprint, drafts are updated or finished.
5. UI changes [are approved](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/development-groups#drafting-process), and the UI changes are brought back into the sprint or are estimated.


### Write a user story

Product Managers [write user stories](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/product-groups#writing-a-good-user-story) in the [drafting board](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/-product-backlog-coming-soon-6192dd66ea2562000faea25c/board). The drafting board is shared by every [product group](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/development-groups).


### Consider a feature eligible to be flagged

At Fleet, features are placed behind feature flags if the changes could affect Fleet's availability of existing functionalities. The following highlights should be considered when deciding if we should leverage feature flags:

- The feature flag must be disabled by default.
- The feature flag will not be permanent. This means that the Directly Responsible Individual
 (DRI) who decides a feature flag should be introduced is also responsible for creating an issue to track the
  feature's progress towards removing the feature flag and including the feature in a stable
  release.
- The feature flag will not be advertised. For example, advertising in the documentation on fleetdm.com/docs, release notes, release blog posts, and Twitter.

> Fleet's feature flag guidelines is borrowed from GitLab's ["When to use feature flags" section](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#when-to-use-feature-flags) of their handbook. Check out [GitLab's "Feature flags only when needed" video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQaGqyolOd8) for an explanation of the costs of introducing feature flags.


### View Fleet usage statistics

In order to understand the usage of the Fleet product, we [collect statistics](https://fleetdm.com/docs/using-fleet/usage-statistics) from installations where this functionality is enabled.

Fleeties can view these statistics in the Google spreadsheet [Fleet
usage](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Mh7Vf4kJL8b5TWlHxcX7mYwaakZMg_ZGNLY3kl1VI-c/edit#gid=0)
available in Google Drive.

Some of the data is forwarded to [Datadog](https://us5.datadoghq.com/dashboard/7pb-63g-xty/usage-statistics?from_ts=1682952132131&to_ts=1685630532131&live=true) and is available to Fleeties.


### Prepare reference docs for release

Every change to how Fleet is used is reflected live on the website in reference documentation **at release day** (REST API, config surface, tables, and other already-existing docs under /docs/using-fleet).

To make sure this happens, first, the [DRI for what goes in a release](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/communications#directly-responsible-individuals-dris) @ mentions the [API design DRI](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/communications#directly-responsible-individuals-dris) in a message in [#help-engineering Slack channel](https://fleetdm.slack.com/archives/C019WG4GH0A) when we cut the release candidate (RC). 

Next, the API design DRI reviews all user stories and bugs with the release milestone to check that all reference doc PRs are merged into the reference docs release branch. To see which stories were pushed to the next release, and thus which reference doc changes need to be removed from the branch, the API design DRI filters issues by the `~pushed` label and the next release's milestone.

To signal that the reference docs branch is ready for release, the API design DRI opens a PR to `main`, adds the DRI for what goes in a release as the reviewer, and adds the release milestone.

> Anytime there is a missing or incorrect configuration option or REST API endpoint in the docs, it is treated as a released bug to be filed and fixed ASAP.

### Interview a Product Designer candidate

Ensure the interview process follows these steps in order. This process must follow [creating a new position](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/leadership#creating-a-new-position) through [receiving job applications](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/leadership#receiving-job-applications).

1. **Reach out**: Send an email or LinkedIn message introducing yourself. Include the URL for the position, your Calendly URL, and invite the candidate to schedule a 30 minute introduction call.
2. **Conduct screening call**: Discuss the requirements of the position with the candidate, and answer any questions they have about Fleet. Look for alignment with [Fleet's values](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company#values) and technical expertise necessary to meet the requirements of the role.
2. **Deliver design challenge**: Share the [design challenge](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S4fD5fPUU9YUjlKy2YAbRZPb_IK4EPkmmO7j09iPWR8/edit) and ask them to complete and send their project back within 5 business days.
5. **Schedule design challenge interview**: Send the candidate a Calendly link for 1 hour call to review the candidate's project. The goal is to understand the design capabilities of the candidate. An additional Product Designer can optionally join if available.
6. **Schedule EM interview**: Send the candidate a calendly link for 30m talk with the Engineering Manager (EM) of the [product group](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/product-groups#current-product-groups) the candidate will be working with.
7. **Schedule CTO interview**: Send the candidate a calendly link for 30m talk with our CTO @lukeheath.

If the candidate passes all of these steps then continue with [hiring a new team member](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/leadership#hiring-a-new-team-member).
