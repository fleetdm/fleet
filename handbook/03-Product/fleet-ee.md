### Fleet EE

##### Communicating design changes to Engineering
For something NEW that has been added to [Figma Fleet EE (current, dev-ready)](https://www.figma.com/file/qpdty1e2n22uZntKUZKEJl/?node-id=0%3A1):
1. Create a new [GitHub issue](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/issues/new)
2. Detail the required changes (including page links to the relevant layouts), then assign it to the __“Initiatives”__ project.

> ___NOTE:__ Artwork and layouts in Figma Fleet EE (current, dev-ready) are final assets, ready for implementation. Therefore, it’s important NOT to use the “idea” label, as designs in this document are more than ideas - they are something that WILL be implemented._

3. Navigate to the [Initiatives project](https://github.com/orgs/fleetdm/projects/8), and hit “+ Add cards”, pick the new issue, and drag it into the “🤩Inspire me” column.

##### Communicating unplanned design changes

For issues related to something that was ALREADY in Figma Fleet EE (current, dev-ready), but __implemented differently__, e.g, padding/spacing inconsistency etc. Create a [bug issue](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug%2C%3Areproduce&template=bug-report.md&title=) and detail the required changes.
