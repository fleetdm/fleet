## Company

### About Fleet

Fleet Device Management Inc is an open core company that sells subscriptions that offer more features and support for Fleet.

We are dedicated to making Fleet the best management platform for [osquery](https://osquery.io), the leading open source endpoint agent.

#### History

##### 2014: Origins of osquery
In 2014, our CTO Zach Wasserman, together with [Mike Arpaia](https://twitter.com/mikearpaia/status/1357455391588839424) and the rest of their team at Facebook, created an open source project called [osquery](https://osquery.io).


##### 2016: Origins of Fleet v1.0
A few years later, Zach, Mike Arpaia, and their team at [Kolide](https://kolide.com) created Fleet: an open source platform that made it easier and more productive to use osquery in an enterprise setting.

##### 2019: The growing community
When Kolide's attention shifted away from Fleet and towards their separate, user-focused SaaS offering, the Fleet community took over maintenance of the open source project. After his time at Kolide, Zach continued as lead maintainer of Fleet.  He spent 2019 consulting and working with the growing open source community to support and extend the capabilities of the Fleet platform.

##### 2020: Fleet was incorporated
Zach partnered with our CEO, Mike McNeil, to found a new, independent company: Fleet Device Management Inc.  In November 2020, we [announced](https://medium.com/fleetdm/a-new-fleet-d4096c7de978) the transition and kicked off the logistics of moving the GitHub repository.

### About the handbook
#### Why bother?
The Fleet handbook is inspired by (and heavily influenced by) the [GitLab team handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/about/).  It shares the same [advantages](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/about/#advantages) and will probably undergo a similar [evolution](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/ceo/#evolution-of-the-handbook).

#### Where's the rest of the handbook?
While this handbook is inspired by [GitLab's handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/), it is nowhere near as complete (yet!)  We will continue to add and update information in this handbook, and gradually migrate information from [Fleet's shared Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1StSOI3HNcsl9VleXxNWfUBT2co7h44OG) as time allows.
