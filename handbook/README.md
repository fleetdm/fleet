# Welcome to Fleet

## Introduction

The Fleet handbook is the ultimate guide on how we run our company. We value [transparency](./company.md#openness), so this handbook is open to the world. We encourage feedback, and [contributions](./handbook.md#contributing-to-the-handbook). Please feel free to click and edit any part of these pages to suggest improvements. Together, we can become even better!
