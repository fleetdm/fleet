# Fleet handbook

## Purpose
The Fleet handbook aims to capture all processes relevant to Fleet and grow into our version of the GitLab handbook. It's meant to be a collaborative document that every Fleet teammate uses and contributes to for all company processes and procedures. As an all-remote company, clear documentation is essential to our effectiveness, and this handbook makes it easy to reference with deep links so that the team can use it as a short-hand to share expectations of how to approach a task, and for all to update regularly as we improve our approach.

## Editing the handbook
The handbook is stored in a git repository. You can make edits to the repo by submitting a pull request.

## Where's the rest of the handbook?
We will gradually move information here from Google Docs as time allows.
