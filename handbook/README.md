# Fleet handbook

The Fleet company handbook is the living knowledge base describing how we do things at Fleet Device Management, Inc.  Every Fleet team member uses and contributes to the handbook.  It is open to the world, and we welcome feedback.  Please make a pull request to suggest improvements or add clarifications.  Use [issues](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/issues) to ask questions.

## Company

### About Fleet

Fleet Device Management Inc is an open core company that sells subscriptions that offer more features and support for Fleet.

We are dedicated to making Fleet the best management platform for [osquery](https://osquery.io), the leading open source endpoint agent.

#### History

##### 2014: Origins of osquery
In 2014, our CTO Zach Wasserman, together with [Mike Arpaia](https://twitter.com/mikearpaia/status/1357455391588839424) and the rest of their team at Facebook, created an open source project called [osquery](https://osquery.io).

##### 2016: Origins of Fleet v1.0
A few years later, Zach, Mike Arpaia, and [Jason Meller](https://honest.security) founded [Kolide](https://kolide.com) and created Fleet: an open source platform that made it easier and more productive to use osquery in an enterprise setting.

##### 2019: The growing community
When Kolide's attention shifted away from Fleet and towards their separate, user-focused SaaS offering, the Fleet community took over maintenance of the open source project. After his time at Kolide, Zach continued as lead maintainer of Fleet.  He spent 2019 consulting and working with the growing open source community to support and extend the capabilities of the Fleet platform.

##### 2020: Fleet was incorporated
Zach partnered with our CEO, Mike McNeil, to found a new, independent company: Fleet Device Management Inc.  In November 2020, we [announced](https://medium.com/fleetdm/a-new-fleet-d4096c7de978) the transition and kicked off the logistics of moving the GitHub repository.


### Culture

### All remote
Fleet is an all-remote conpany, with teammates spread across 3 continents and 5 time zones.

### Openness
The majority of the code, documentation, and content we create at Fleet is public and source-available, and we strive to be broadly open and transparent in the way we run the business; as much as confidentiality agreements (and time) allow.  We perform better with an audience, and our audience performs better with us.

### Spending company money
As we continue to expand our own company policies, we use [GitLab's expense policy](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/spending-company-money/) as a guide for company spending.

In brief, this means that as a Fleet team member, you may:

* Spend company money like it is your own money.
* Be responsible for what you need to purchase or expense in order to do your job effectively.
* Feel free to make purchases __in the interest of the company__ without asking for permission beforehand (when in doubt, do __inform__ your manager prior to purchase, or as soon as possible after the purchase).

For more detailed information about __spending guidelines and limits__, please read [GitLab's expense policy](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/spending-company-money/)


### About the handbook
#### Why bother?
The Fleet handbook is inspired by (and heavily influenced by) the [GitLab team handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/about/).  It shares the same [advantages](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/about/#advantages) and will probably undergo a similar [evolution](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/ceo/#evolution-of-the-handbook).

#### Where's the rest of the handbook?
While this handbook is inspired by [GitLab's handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/), it is nowhere near as complete (yet!)  We will continue to add and update information in this handbook, and gradually migrate information from [Fleet's shared Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1StSOI3HNcsl9VleXxNWfUBT2co7h44OG) as time allows.
