### About the handbook

#### Why bother?
The Fleet handbook is inspired by (and heavily influenced by) the [GitLab team handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/about/).  It shares the same [advantages](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/about/#advantages) and will probably undergo a similar [evolution](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/ceo/#evolution-of-the-handbook).

#### Where's the rest of the handbook?
While this handbook is inspired by [GitLab's handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/), it is nowhere near as complete (yet!)  We will continue to add and update information in this handbook, and gradually migrate information from [Fleet's shared Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1StSOI3HNcsl9VleXxNWfUBT2co7h44OG) as time allows.
