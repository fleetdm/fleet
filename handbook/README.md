# Fleet handbook

## Purpose
The Fleet handbook aims to capture the company processes here at Fleet.  We want it to grow into our version of the GitLab handbook.  It is a collaborative document that every Fleet team member uses and contributes to.

As an all-remote company, it is especially important to maintain clear documentation to be effective.  Using a handbook makes it easy for anyone at Fleet to reference how to do almost anything, and to make updates regularly as we improve our approach.

## Editing the handbook
The handbook is stored in a git repository. You can make edits to the repo by submitting a pull request.

## Where's the rest of the handbook?
We will gradually move information here from Google Docs as time allows.
