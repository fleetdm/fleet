# Community spin

This living document outlines the community support spin process and preparation for Roundup at Fleet.

Roundup is a weekly meeting at Fleet that provides time to discuss action items from that are collected during the community triage.

## Goals

- Get familiar with and stay abreast of what our community wants and the problems they're having.

- Make people feel heard and understood.  

- Celebrate contributions. 

- Identify bugs, feature requests, pull requests and questions.  Revisit old threads to let people know about improvements.

The individual(s) tasked with performing the community support spin process should complete the following at a daily cadence:

- Read through the posts since the last spin.

- Engage, if you see a quick and easy opportunity to do so.

## Roundup preparation

The 🐄 Roundup meet occurs at Fleet one every week. One to two days prior to the meeting, the individual tasked with leading the Roundup meet will revisit old threads and determine which items are actionable.

Actionable items should be added to the 🐄 Roundup Google doc in the following format:

TODO outline the format of action items and provide an example of each "type" (feature request, question, pull request, bug)

TODO we should also emphasize why each example is a valid action item.
