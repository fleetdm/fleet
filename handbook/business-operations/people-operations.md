## Relocating
When Fleeties relocate, there are vendors that need to be notified of the change. 

Before relocating, please [let the company know in advance](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/business-operations#intake) by following the directions listed in the relevant issue template ("Moving").

### Celebrations
At Fleet we like to celebrate sinificant milestones for our teammates! We do this in a variety of ways including company-wide slack messaging. If you would prefer we didn't celebrate your milestone, please submit an [intake issue](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/business-operations#intake) to ensure the team has record of your preference.

#### Workiversaries
We're happy you've ventured a trip around the sun with Fleet- let's celebrate! The POps team will post in Slack to highlight your dedication and contribution to Fleet, giving an opportunity for teammates to thare their appreciation of your contribution!
Fleet also [evaluates and (if necessary) updates compensation decisions yearly](#compensation-changes), shortly after the anniversary of a team member's start date.

## Benefits
In this section, you can find information about Fleet's benefit strategies and decisions.

### Paid time off
What matters most is your results, which are driven by your focus, your availability to collaborate, and the time and consideration you put into your work. Fleet offers all team members unlimited time off. Whether you're sick, you want to take a trip, you are eager for some time to relax, or you need to get some chores done around the house, any reason is a good reason.
For team members working in jurisdictions that require certain mandatory sick leave or PTO policies, Fleet complies to the extent required by law.

#### Taking time off
When you need to take time off, follow this process:
- Let your manager and team know the days when you will be out by posting a message in your department Slack channel mentioning your manager, with when and how long.
- Life happens and things come up.  But as soon as you know when you'll be out, let the company know.  (Extra notice helps!)
- Find someone to cover anything that needs covering while you're out and communicate what they need to take over the responsibilities as well as who to refer to for help (e.g., meetings, planned tasks, unfinished business, important Slack/email threads, anything where someone might be depending on you).
- Mark an all-day "Out of office" event in Google Calendar for the day(s) you're taking off or for the hours that you will be off if less than a day. Google Calendar recognizes the event title "OOO" and will give you the option to decline existing and new meetings or just new meetings. You are expected to attend any meetings that you have accepted, so be sure to decline meetings you are not going to attend.
- If you can’t complete these steps because you need to take the day off quickly due to an emergency, let your manager know and they will help you complete the handoff.
- If you ever want to take a day off, and the only thing stopping you is internal (Fleetie-only) meetings, don’t stress. Consider, “Is this a meeting that I can reschedule to another day, or is this a meeting that can go on without me and not interfere with the company’s plans?” Talk to your manager if you’re unsure, but it is perfectly OK to reschedule internal meetings that can wait so that you can take a day off.
- This process is the same for any days you take off, whether it's a holiday or you just need a break.

   
#### Holidays
At Fleet, we have team members with various employment classifications in many different countries worldwide. Fleet is a US company, but we think you should choose the days you want to work and what days you are on holiday, rather than being locked into any particular nation or culture's expectation about when to take time off.
When a team member joins Fleet, they pick one of the following holiday schedules:
 - **Traditional**: This is based on the country where you work. Non-US team members should let their managers know the dates of national holidays.
 **Or**
 - **Freestyle**: You have no set schedule and start with no holidays. Then you add the days that are holidays to you.

Either way, it's up to you to make sure that your responsibilities are covered, and that your team knows you're out of the office.

#### New parent leave
Fleet gives new parents six weeks of paid leave. After six weeks, if you don't feel ready to return yet, we'll set up a quick call to discuss and work together to come up with a plan to help you return to work gradually or when you're ready.

### Retirement contributions
#### US based team members
Commencing in August 2023, Fleet offers the ability for US based team members to contribute to a 401(k) retirement plan directly from their salary. Team members will be auto-enrolled in our plan with Guideline at a default 1% contribution unless they opt out or change their contribution amount within 30 days of commencement. Fleet currently does not match any contributions made by team members to 401(k) plans.

#### Non-US team members
Fleet meets the relevant country's retirement contribution requirements for team members outside the US.

### Coworking
Your Brex card may be used for up to $500 USD per month in coworking costs. Please get prior approval by making a [custom request to the business operations team](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/business-operations#intake).

## Compensation
Compensation at Fleet is determined by benchmarking using [Pave](https://pave.com). Annual raises are not guaranteed, instead we ensure teammates are compensated fairly based on the role, experience, location, and performance relative to benchmarks.

### Payroll dates
US based Fleeties get paid on the last business day of the month. International teammates pay dates follow the same structure as US pay, unless there are in-country requirement that dictate a more frequent cadence.

### Compensation changes
Fleet evaluates and (if necessary) updates compensation decisions yearly, shortly after the anniversary of a team member's start date. The process for that evaluation and update is:
- On the first Friday of the month, the Head of BizOps posts in the `#help-classified` channel with the list of teammates celebrating anniversaries over the next month.
- On the day of the fleetiversary, the Head of BizOps or executive team member will post in `#random` celebrating the tenure of the teammate.
- The Head of BizOps confers with manager or head of department and prepares compensation benchmarking data and schedules time with the CEO and CTO over an existing 1:1 to discuss if an adjustment needs to be made to compensation.
- During the 1:1 call, founders review benchmarking for role and geography, and decide if there will be an adjustment.
- Head of BizOps posts to slack in `#help-classified` with the decision on compensation changes and effective date, if any.
- If a change is to be made, the Head of BizOps communicates decision to the teammate's people manager, who then communicates to their teammate.
- Head of BizOps updates the respective payroll platform (Gusto or Plane) and [equity spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_GJlqnWWIQBiZFOoyl9YbTr72bg5qdSSp4O3kuKm1Jc/edit?usp=sharing) (internal doc).
- If an additional equity grant is part of this compensation change, the previous equity and new situation is noted in detail in the "Notes" column of the equity plan, and the "Grant started?" column is set back to "todo" to add it to the queue for the next time grants are processed (quarterly).

## Team member onboarding

### Before the start date

Fleet is open source and anyone can contribute at any time.  Before a core team member's start date, they are welcome to contribute, but not expected to.

#### Recommendations for new teammates
Welcome to Fleet!

1. Understand the company
2. Take the time to get trained
3. Get comfortable with the tools
4. Immerse yourself in the world of device management and cybersecurity.

> Please see Fleet's ["🥽 Recommendations for new teammates"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xcnqKB9HHPd94POnZ_7LATiy_VjO2kJdbYx0SAgKVao/edit#).

### Training expectations
It's [important](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/why-this-way#why-the-emphasis-on-training) that every team member at Fleet takes the time to get fully trained and onboarded. 
When a new team member joins Fleet, we create an onboarding issue for them in the [fleetdm/confidential](https://github.com/fleetdm/confidential) repo using this [issue template](https://github.com/fleetdm/confidential/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/onboarding.md). 
We want to make sure that the new team member will be able to complete every task in their issue. To make sure the new team member is successful in their onboarding, we customize their issue by commenting on any tasks they won't need to complete.
We believe in taking onboarding and training seriously and that the onboarding template is an essential source of truth and good use of time for every single new hire. If managers see a step that they don't feel is necessary, they should make a pull request to the [onboarding template](https://github.com/fleetdm/confidential/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/onboarding.md).

Expectations during onboarding:
- Onboarding time (all checkboxes checked) is a KPI for the business operations team.  Our goal is 14 days or less.
- The first 3 weekdays (excluding days off) for **every new team member** at Fleet is reserved for completing onboarding tasks from the checkboxes in their onboarding issue.  New team members **should not work on anything else during this time**, whether or not other tasks are stacking up or assigned.  It is OK, expected, and appreciated for new team members to **remind their manager and colleagues** of this [important](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/why-this-way#why-the-emphasis-on-training) responsibility.
- Even after the first 3 days, during the rest of their first 2 weeks, completing onboarding tasks on time is a new team member's [highest priority](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/why-this-way#why-the-emphasis-on-training).

### Sightseeing tour
During their first day at Fleet, new team members join a sightseeing tour call with the acting Head of People (CEO). During this call, the new team member will participate in an interactive tour of the seven main attractions in our all-remote company, including the primary tools used company-wide, what the human experience is like, and when/why we use them at Fleet.

In this meeting, we'll take a look at:
- Handbook: values, purpose, key pages to pay special attention to
- GitHub issues: the living bloodstream of the company.
- Kanban boards: the bulletin board of quests you can get and how you update status and let folks know things are done.
- Google Calendar: the future.
- Gmail: like any mailbox, full of junk mail, plus some important things, so it is important to check carefully.
- Salesforce: the Rolodex.
- Google Docs: the archives.
- Slack:
  - The "office" (#g-, #general).
  - The walkie talkies (DMs).
  - The watering hole (#oooh-, #random, #news, #help-).

### Contributor experience training
During their first week at Fleet, every new team member schedules a contributor experience training call with the acting Head of People (CEO). During this call, the new team member will share their screen, and the acting Head of People will:
- make sure emails will get seen and responded to quickly.
- make sure Slack messages will get seen and responded to quickly.
- make sure you know where your issues are tracked, which kanban board you use, and what the columns mean.
- make sure you can succeed with submitting a PR with the GitHub web editor, modifying docs or handbook, and working with Markdown.
- talk about Google calendar.
- give you a quick tour of the Fleet Google drive folder.

<!-- 
TODO: Merge this commented-out stuff with the above

Agenda:
A 60-minute call with Mike where you will share your screen, and she will work with you to...
Make sure Slack messages are going to get seen and responded to quickly and disable email notifications in Slack
Make sure you know where your issues are tracked, which kanban board you use, what the columns mean
Make sure you can succeed with submitting a PR in github.com, modifying docs or handbook, working with Markdown
Make sure emails are going to get seen and responded to quickly (make sure inbox management is going to be productive, talk about filters, unsubscribe)
Make sure you know how to see and subscribe to other team members' calendars and that you can add yourself to an event on someone else's calendar.
A quick tour of the Google drive folder (access look correct? Ok. Give access to executed documents on the shared drive as needed) show how to use “Add to drive” or “favorite,” or just a browser bookmark, so the folder is easily accessible. This is where things go. It's the archive.)
Make sure you know how to share a google doc into the folder for all fleeties to see and access.

### Onboarding retrospective
At the end of their first two weeks of onboarding at Fleet, every new team member schedules a onboarding retro call with the acting Head of People (CEO).  Agenda: 
> Welcome once again to the team! Please tell me about your first few weeks at Fleet. How did your onboarding/training go? What didn't you manage to get to? Anything you weren't sure how to do? Any feedback on how we can make the experience better for Fleet's next hire?

Fleet prioritizes a [bias for action](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company#ownership).  If possible, apply onboarding feedback to the handbook and issue templates in realtime, during this call.  This avoids backlogging tasks that may just get out of date before we get around to them anyway.
