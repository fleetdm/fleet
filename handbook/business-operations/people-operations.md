# People Operations

## Relocating
When Fleeties relocate, there are vendors that need to be notified of the change. 

Before relocating, please [let the company know in advance](#intake) by following the directions listed in the relevant issue template ("Moving").

## People Operations rituals
### Celebrations
At Fleet we like to celebrate sinificant milestones for our teammates! We do this in a variety of ways including company-wide slack messaging. If you would prefer we didn't celebrate your milestone, please submit an [intake issue](#intake) to ensure the team has record of your preference.

#### Workiversaries
We're happy you've ventured a trip around the sun with Fleet- let's celebrate! The POps team will post in Slack to highlight your dedication and contribution to Fleet, giving an opportunity for teammates to thare their appreciation of your contribution!
Fleet also [evaluates and (if necessary) updates compensation decisions yearly](#compensation-changes), shortly after the anniversary of a team member's start date.

## Benefits
In this section, you can find information about Fleet's benefit strategies and decisions.

### Paid time off
What matters most is your results, which are driven by your focus, your availability to collaborate, and the time and consideration you put into your work. Fleet offers all team members unlimited time off. Whether you're sick, you want to take a trip, you are eager for some time to relax, or you need to get some chores done around the house, any reason is a good reason.
For team members working in jurisdictions that require certain mandatory sick leave or PTO policies, Fleet complies to the extent required by law.

#### Taking time off
When you take any time off, you should follow this process:
- Let your manager and team know as soon as possible (i.e., post a message in your team's Slack channel with when and how long).
- Find someone to cover anything that needs covering while you're out and communicate what they need to take over the responsibilities as well as who to refer to for help (e.g., meetings, planned tasks, unfinished business, important Slack/email threads, anything where someone might be depending on you).
- Mark an all-day "Out of office" event in Google Calendar for the day(s) you're taking off or for the hours that you will be off if less than a day. Google Calendar recognizes the event title "OOO" and will give you the option to decline existing and new meetings or just new meetings. You are expected to attend any meetings that you have accepted, so be sure to decline meetings you are not going to attend.
If you can’t complete the above because you need to take the day off quickly due to an emergency, let your manager know and they will help you complete the handoff.
If you ever want to take a day off, and the only thing stopping you is internal (Fleetie-only) meetings, don’t stress. Consider, “Is this a meeting that I can reschedule to another day, or is this a meeting that can go on without me and not interfere with the company’s plans?” Talk to your manager if you’re unsure, but it is perfectly OK to reschedule internal meetings that can wait so that you can take a day off.
This process is the same for any days you take off, whether it's a holiday or you just need a break.
   
#### Holidays
At Fleet, we have team members with various employment classifications in many different countries worldwide. Fleet is a US company, but we think you should choose the days you want to work and what days you are on holiday, rather than being locked into any particular nation or culture's expectation about when to take time off.
When a team member joins Fleet, they pick one of the following holiday schedules:
 - **Traditional**: This is based on the country where you work. Non-US team members should let their managers know the dates of national holidays.
 **Or**
 - **Freestyle**: You have no set schedule and start with no holidays. Then you add the days that are holidays to you.

Either way, it's up to you to make sure that your responsibilities are covered, and that your team knows you're out of the office.

#### New parent leave
Fleet gives new parents six weeks of paid leave. After six weeks, if you don't feel ready to return yet, we'll set up a quick call to discuss and work together to come up with a plan to help you return to work gradually or when you're ready.

### Retirement contributions
#### US based team members
Commencing in August 2023, Fleet offers the ability for US based team members to contribute to a 401(k) retirement plan directly from their salary. Team members will be auto-enrolled in our plan with Guideline at a default 1% contribution unless they opt out or change their contribution amount within 30 days of commencement. Fleet currently does not match any contributions made by team members to 401(k) plans.

#### Non-US team members
Fleet meets the relevant country's retirement contribution requirements for team members outside the US.

### Coworking
Your Brex card may be used for up to $500 USD per month in coworking costs. Please get prior approval by making a [custom request to the business operations team](#intake).

## Compensation
Compensation at Fleet is determined by benchmarking using [Pave](https://pave.com). Annual raises are not guaranteed, instead we ensure teammates are compensated fairly based on the role, experience, location, and performance relative to benchmarks.

### Compensation changes
Fleet evaluates and (if necessary) updates compensation decisions yearly, shortly after the anniversary of a team member's start date. The process for that evaluation and update is:
- On the first Friday of the month, the Head of BizOps posts in the `#help-classified` channel with the list of teammates celebrating anniversaries over the next month.
- On the day of the fleetiversary, the Head of BizOps or executive team member will post in `#random` celebrating the tenure of the teammate.
- The Head of BizOps confers with manager or head of department and prepares compensation benchmarking data and schedules time with the CEO and CTO over an existing 1:1 to discuss if an adjustment needs to be made to compensation.
- During the 1:1 call, founders review benchmarking for role and geography, and decide if there will be an adjustment.
- Head of BizOps posts to slack in `#help-classified` with the decision on compensation changes and effective date, if any.
- If a change is to be made, the Head of BizOps communicates decision to the teammate's people manager, who then communicates to their teammate.
- Head of BizOps updates the respective payroll platform (Gusto or Plane) and [equity spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_GJlqnWWIQBiZFOoyl9YbTr72bg5qdSSp4O3kuKm1Jc/edit?usp=sharing) (internal doc).
- If an additional equity grant is part of this compensation change, the previous equity and new situation is noted in detail in the "Notes" column of the equity plan, and the "Grant started?" column is set back to "todo" to add it to the queue for the next time grants are processed (quarterly).

## Team member onboarding

### Before the start date

Fleet is open source and anyone can contribute at any time.  Before a core team member's start date, they are welcome to contribute, but not expected to.

#### Recommendations for new teammates
Welcome to Fleet!

1. Understand the company
2. Take the time to get trained
3. Get comfortable with the tools
4. Immerse yourself in the world of device management and cybersecurity.

> Please see Fleet's ["🥽 Recommendations for new teammates"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xcnqKB9HHPd94POnZ_7LATiy_VjO2kJdbYx0SAgKVao/edit#).

### Training expectations
It's [important](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/why-this-way#why-the-emphasis-on-training) that every team member at Fleet takes the time to get fully trained and onboarded. 
When a new team member joins Fleet, we create an onboarding issue for them in the [fleetdm/confidential](https://github.com/fleetdm/confidential) repo using this [issue template](https://github.com/fleetdm/confidential/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/onboarding.md). 
We want to make sure that the new team member will be able to complete every task in their issue. To make sure the new team member is successful in their onboarding, we customize their issue by commenting on any tasks they won't need to complete.
We believe in taking onboarding and training seriously and that the onboarding template is an essential source of truth and good use of time for every single new hire. If managers see a step that they don't feel is necessary, they should make a pull request to the [onboarding template](https://github.com/fleetdm/confidential/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/onboarding.md).

Expectations during onboarding:
- Onboarding time (all checkboxes checked) is a KPI for the business operations team.  Our goal is 14 days or less.
- The first 3 weekdays (excluding days off) for **every new team member** at Fleet is reserved for completing onboarding tasks from the checkboxes in their onboarding issue.  New team members **should not work on anything else during this time**, whether or not other tasks are stacking up or assigned.  It is OK, expected, and appreciated for new team members to **remind their manager and colleagues** of this [important](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/why-this-way#why-the-emphasis-on-training) responsibility.
- Even after the first 3 days, during the rest of their first 2 weeks, completing onboarding tasks on time is a new team member's [highest priority](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/why-this-way#why-the-emphasis-on-training).

### Sightseeing tour
During their first day at Fleet, new team members join a sightseeing tour call with the acting Head of People (CEO). During this call, the new team member will participate in an interactive tour of the seven main attractions in our all-remote company, including the primary tools used company-wide, what the human experience is like, and when/why we use them at Fleet.

In this meeting, we'll take a look at:
- Handbook: values, purpose, key pages to pay special attention to
- GitHub issues: the living bloodstream of the company.
- Kanban boards: the bulletin board of quests you can get and how you update status and let folks know things are done.
- Google Calendar: the future.
- Gmail: like any mailbox, full of junk mail, plus some important things, so it is important to check carefully.
- Salesforce: the Rolodex.
- Google Docs: the archives.
- Slack:
  - The "office" (#g-, #general).
  - The walkie talkies (DMs).
  - The watering hole (#oooh-, #random, #news, #help-).

### Contributor experience training
During their first week at Fleet, every new team member schedules a contributor experience training call with the acting Head of People (CEO). During this call, the new team member will share their screen, and the acting Head of People will:
- make sure emails will get seen and responded to quickly.
- make sure Slack messages will get seen and responded to quickly.
- make sure you know where your issues are tracked, which kanban board you use, and what the columns mean.
- make sure you can succeed with submitting a PR with the GitHub web editor, modifying docs or handbook, and working with Markdown.
- talk about Google calendar.
- give you a quick tour of the Fleet Google drive folder.

<!-- 
TODO: Merge this commented-out stuff with the above

Agenda:
A 60-minute call with Mike where you will share your screen, and she will work with you to...
Make sure Slack messages are going to get seen and responded to quickly and disable email notifications in Slack
Make sure you know where your issues are tracked, which kanban board you use, what the columns mean
Make sure you can succeed with submitting a PR in github.com, modifying docs or handbook, working with Markdown
Make sure emails are going to get seen and responded to quickly (make sure inbox management is going to be productive, talk about filters, unsubscribe)
Make sure you know how to see and subscribe to other team members' calendars and that you can add yourself to an event on someone else's calendar.
A quick tour of the Google drive folder (access look correct? Ok. Give access to executed documents on the shared drive as needed) show how to use “Add to drive” or “favorite,” or just a browser bookmark, so the folder is easily accessible. This is where things go. It's the archive.)
Make sure you know how to share a google doc into the folder for all fleeties to see and access.
A high level overview of the Company values

### Onboarding retrospective
At the end of their first two weeks of onboarding at Fleet, every new team member schedules a onboarding retro call with the acting Head of People (CEO).  Agenda: 
> Welcome once again to the team! Please tell me about your first few weeks at Fleet. How did your onboarding/training go? What didn't you manage to get to? Anything you weren't sure how to do? Any feedback on how we can make the experience better for Fleet's next hire?

Fleet prioritizes a [bias for action](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company#ownership).  If possible, apply onboarding feedback to the handbook and issue templates in realtime, during this call.  This avoids backlogging tasks that may just get out of date before we get around to them anyway.

## Tracking hours
Fleet asks US-based hourly contributors to track hours in Gusto, and contributors outside the US to track hours via Pilot.co.

This applies to anyone who gets paid by the hour, including consultants and hourly core team members of any employment classification, inside or outside of the US.

> _**Note:** If a contributor uses their own time tracking process or tools, then it is OK to track the extra time spent tracking!  Contributors at Fleet are evaluated based on their results, not the number of hours they work._

### Informing managers about hours worked
Every Friday at 1:00pm CT, we gather hours worked for anyone who gets paid hourly by Fleet. This includes core team members and consultants, regardless of employment classification, and regardless whether inside or outside of the United States.

Here's how:
- For every hourly core team member in Gusto or Pilot.co, look up their manager ([who they report to](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company#org-chart)).
- If any direct report is hourly in Pilot.co and does not submit their hours until the end of the month, still list them, but explain.  (See example below.)
- [Consultants](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/business-operations#hiring) don't have a formal reporting structure or manager. Instead, send their hours worked to the CEO, no matter who the consultant is.

Then, send **the CEO** and **each manager** a direct message in Slack by copying and pasting the following template:

> Here are the hours worked by your direct reports since last Saturday at midnight (YYYY-MM-DD):
> - 🧑‍🚀 Alice Bobberson: 21.25
> - 🧑‍🚀 Charles David: 3.5
> - 🧑‍🚀 Philippe Timebender: (this person's hours will not be available until they invoice at the end of the month)
>
> And here are the hours worked by consultants:
> - 💁 Bombalurina: 0
> - 💁 Jennyanydots: 0
> - 💁 Skimbleshanks: 19
> - 💁 Grizabella: 0
> 
> More info: https://fleetdm.com/handbook/business-operations#informing-managers-about-hours-worked

## Performance feedback
At Fleet, performance feedback is a continuous process. We give feedback (particularly negative) as soon as possible. Most feedback will happen during 1:1 meetings, if not sooner.

## Hiring

At Fleet, we collaborate with [core team members](#creating-a-new-position), [consultants](#hiring-a-consultant), [advisors](#adding-an-advisor), and [outside contributors](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/graphs/contributors) from the community.  

> Are you a new fleetie joining the Business Operations team?  For Loom recordings demonstrating how to make offers, hire, onboard, and more please see [this classified Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fimxQguPOtK-2YLAVjWRNCYqs5TszAHJslhtT_23Ly0/edit).

### Consultants

#### Hiring a consultant

In addition to [core team members](#hiring-a-new-team-member), from time to time Fleet hires consultants who may work for only a handful of hours on short projects.

A consultant is someone who we expect to either:
- complete their relationship with the company in less than 6 weeks
- or have a longer-term relationship with the company, but never work more than 10 hours per week.

Consultants:
- do NOT receive company-issued laptops
- do NOT receive Yubikeys
- do NOT get a "Hiring" issue created for them
- do NOT get a company email address, nor everyone's calendars, nor the shared drive _(with occasional exceptions)_
- do NOT go through training using the contributor onboarding issue.
- do NOT fill any existing [open position](#creating-a-new-position)

Consultants [track time using the company's tools](#tracking-hours) and sign [Fleet's consulting agreement](#sending-a-consulting-agreement).

To hire a consultant, [submit a custom request](#intake) to the business operations team.

> TODO: replace this w/  issue template (see also commented-out notes in hiring.md for some other steps)

#### Who ISN'T a consultant?

If a consultant plans to work _more_ than 10 hours per week, or for _longer_ than 6 weeks, they should instead be hired as a [core team member](#hiring-a-new-team-member).

Core team members:
- are hired for an existing [open position](#creating-a-new-position)
- are hired using Fleet's "Hiring" issue template, including receiving a company-issued laptop and Yubikeys
- must be onboarded (complete the entire, unabridged onboarding process in Fleet's "Onboarding" issue template)
- must be offboarded
- get an email address
- have a manager and a formal place in the company [org chart](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company#org-chart)
- are listed in ["🧑‍🚀 Fleeties"](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OSLn-ZCbGSjPusHPiR5dwQhheH1K8-xqyZdsOe9y7qc/edit#gid=0)
- are paid as part of the standard payroll ritual for the place they work and their employment classification.

Consultants aren't required to do any of those things.

#### Sending a consulting agreement

To hire a non-US consultant, please [submit a custom request](#intake).

To hire a US-based consultant, send them an agreement using the "Contractor agreement (US)" template in [DocuSign](https://www.docusign.com/).
(This template is located in the "¶¶ Classified templates" folder, which is only accessible via certain Docusign accounts in 1Password.)

> _**Note:** The Docusign template labeled "Contractor agreement (US)" is actually used for both consultants and [core team members in the US who are classified as 1099 contractors or billed corp-to-corp as vendors](#hiring-a-new-team-member).  You may also sometimes hear this referred to as Fleet's "Consulting agreement". Same thing._

To send a US consulting agreement, you'll need the new consultant's name, the term of the service, a summary of the services provided, and the consultant's fee. 

There are some defaults that we use for these agreements:
   - Term: Default to one month unless otherwise discussed.
   - Services rendered: Copy and paste from the [language in this doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b5SGgYEHqDmq5QF8p29WWN3it3XJh3xRT3zG0RdXARo/edit)
   - Work will commence and complete by dates: Start date and end of term date
   - Fee: Get from the consultant.
   - Hours: Default to 10 hr/week.

Then hit send!  After all of the signatures are there, the completed document will automatically be uploaded to the appropriate Google Drive folder, and a Slack message will appear in the `#help-classified` channel.

#### Updating a consultant's fee
 - Direct message Mike McNeil with hourly rate change information.
 - After CEO approval, Mike McNeil will issue a new contractor agreement with the updated fee via DocuSign.

### Advisor

#### Adding an advisor
Advisor agreements are sent through [DocuSign](https://www.docusign.com/), using the "Advisor Agreement"
template.
- Send the advisor agreement. To send a new advisor agreement, you'll need the new advisor's name and the number of shares they are offered. 
- Once you send the agreement, locate an existing empty row and available ID in ["Advisors"](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15knBE2-PrQ1Ad-QcIk0mxCN-xFsATKK9hcifqrm0qFQ/edit#gid=1803674483) and enter the new advisor's information.
   >**_Note:_** *Be sure to mark any columns that haven't been completed yet as "TODO"*

#### Finalizing a new advisor
- Update the ["Advisors"](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15knBE2-PrQ1Ad-QcIk0mxCN-xFsATKK9hcifqrm0qFQ/edit#gid=1803674483) to show that the agreement has been signed, and ask the new advisor to add us on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/71111416), [Crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/fleet-device-management), and [Angellist](https://angel.co/company/fleetdm).
- Update "Equity plan" to reflect updated status and equity grant for this advisor, and to ensure the advisor's equity is queued up for the next quarterly equity grant ritual.

### Core team member
This section is about creating a core team member role, and the hiring process for a new core team member, or Fleetie.

#### Creating a new position

Want to hire?  Here's how to open up a new position on the core team:

> Use these steps to hire a [fleetie, not a consultant](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/business-operations#who-isnt-a-consultant).

<!--
> If you think this job posting may need to stay temporarily classified (¶¶) and not shared company-wide or publicly yet, for any reason, then stop here and send a Slack DM with your proposal to the CEO instead of modifying ["🧑‍🚀 Fleeties"](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OSLn-ZCbGSjPusHPiR5dwQhheH1K8-xqyZdsOe9y7qc/edit) (which is visible company-wide) or submitting a draft pull request to "Open positions" (which is public).
-->

1. **Propose headcount:** Add the proposed position to ["🧑‍🚀 Fleeties"](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OSLn-ZCbGSjPusHPiR5dwQhheH1K8-xqyZdsOe9y7qc/edit#gid=0) in an empty row (but using one of the existing IDs.  Unsure?  Ask for help.)  Be sure to include job title, manager, and department. Set the start date to the first Monday of the next month (This position is still only proposed (not approved), but would make it easier for the approver to have the date set).
2. **Propose job description:** Copy, personalize, and publish the job description:
   - _Duplicate file:_ Locate [one of the existing job description files inside `handbook/company/`](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/tree/main/handbook/company) and duplicate it into a new handbook subpage.  If no other open job descriptions currently exist, you can [copy and paste the raw text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fleetdm/fleet/586194b771aa4ff7aa18072bd061720f94719d29/handbook/company/product-designer.md) from an [old job description](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/blob/586194b771aa4ff7aa18072bd061720f94719d29/handbook/company/product-designer.md).
     - _Filename:_ Use the [same style of filename](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/blob/586194b771aa4ff7aa18072bd061720f94719d29/handbook/company/product-designer.md), but based on the new job title.  (This filename will determine the living URL on fleetdm.com where candidates can apply.)
     - _Contents:_ Keep the structure of the document [identical](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fleetdm/fleet/586194b771aa4ff7aa18072bd061720f94719d29/handbook/company/product-designer.md).  Change only the job title, "Responsibilities", and "Experience".
   - _Add to list of open positions:_ In [the same pull request](https://www.loom.com/share/75da64632a93415cbe0e7752107c1af2), add a link to your new job posting to the bottom of the list of ["📖 Company#Open positions"](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company#open-positions) in the handbook.
     - State the proposed job title, include the appropriate departmental emoji, and link to the "living" fleetdm.com URL; not the GitHub URL.

> _**Note:** The "living" URL where the new page will eventually exist on fleetdm.com won't ACTUALLY exist until your pull request is merged.  For now, if you were to visit this URL, you'd just see a 404 error.  So how can you determine this URL?  To understand the pattern, visit other job description pages from the [live handbook](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company#open-positions), and examine their URLs in your browser._

3. **Get it approved and merged:**  When you submit your proposed job description, the CEO will be automatically tagged for review and get a notification.  He will consider where this role fits into Fleet's strategy and decide whether Fleet will open this position at this time.  He will review the data carefully to try and catch any simple mistakes, then tentatively budget cash and equity compensation and document this compensation research.  He will set a tentative start date (which also indicates this position is no longer just "proposed"; it's now part of the hiring plan.)  Then the CEO will start a `#hiring-xxxxx-YYYY` Slack channel, at-mentioning the original proposer and letting them know their position is approved.  (Unless it isn't.)

> _**Why bother with approvals?**  We avoid cancelling or significantly changing a role after opening it.  It hurts candidates too much.  Instead, get the position approved first, before you start recruiting and interviewing.  This gives you a sounding board and avoids misunderstandings._

#### Approving a new position
When review is requested on a proposal to open a new position, the 🐈‍⬛ CEO will complete the following steps when reviewing the pull request:

1. **Consider role and reporting structure:** Confirm the new row in "Fleeties" has a manager, job title, and department, that it doesn't have any corrupted spreadsheet formulas or formatting, and that the start date is set to the first Monday of the next month.
2. **Read job description:** Confirm the job description consists only of changes to "Responsibilities" and "Experience," with an appropriate filename, and that the content looks accurate, is grammatically correct, and is otherwise ready to post in a public job description on fleetdm.com.
3. **Budget compensation:** Ballpark and document compensation research for the role based on 
   - _Add screenshot:_ Scroll to the very bottom of ["¶¶ 💌 Compensation decisions (offer math)"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NQ-IjcOTbyFluCWqsFLMfP4SvnopoXDcX0civ-STS5c/edit#heading=h.slomq4whmyas) and add a new heading for the role, pattern-matching off of the names of other nearby role headings. Then create written documentation of your research for future reference.  The easiest way to do this is to take screenshots of the [relevant benchmarks in Pave](https://pave.com) and paste those screenshots under the new heading.
   - _Update team database:_ Update the row in ["¶¶ 🥧 Equity plan"](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_GJlqnWWIQBiZFOoyl9YbTr72bg5qdSSp4O3kuKm1Jc/edit#gid=0) using the benchmarked compensation and share count.
     - _Salary:_ Enter the salary: If the role has variable compensation, use the role's OTE (on-target earning estimate) as the budgeted salary amount, and leave a note in the "Notes (¶¶)" cell clarifying the role's bonus or commission structure.
     - _Equity:_ Enter the equity as a number of shares, watching the percentage that is automatically calculated in the next cell.  Keep guessing different numbers of shares until you get the derived percentage looking like what you want to see.

4. **Decide**: Decide whether to approve this role or to consider it a different time.  If approving, then:
   - _Create Slack channel:_ Create a private "#hiring-xxxxxx-YYYY" Slack channel (where "xxxxxx" is the job title and YYYY is the current year) for discussion and invite the hiring manager.
   - _Publish opening:_ Approve and merge the pull request.  The job posting go live within ≤10 minutes.
   - _Reply to requestor:_ Post a comment on the pull request, being sure to include a direct link to their live job description on fleetdm.com.  (This is the URL where candidates can go to read about the job and apply.  For example: `fleetdm.com/handbook/company/product-designer`):
     ```
     The new opening is now live!  Candidates can apply at fleetdm.com/handbook/company/railway-conductor.
     ```

> _**Note:** Most columns of the "Equity plan" are updated automatically when "Fleeties" is, based on the unique identifier of each row, like `🧑‍🚀890`.  (Advisors have their own flavor of unique IDs, such as `🦉755`, which are defined in ["Advisors and investors"](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15knBE2-PrQ1Ad-QcIk0mxCN-xFsATKK9hcifqrm0qFQ/edit).)_

#### Recruiting
Fleet accepts job applications, but the company does not list positions on general purpose job boards.  This prevents us being overwhelmed with candidates so we can fulfill our goal of responding promptly to every applicant.

This means that outbound recruiting, 3rd party recruiters, and references from team members are important aspect of the company's hiring strategy.  Fleet's CEO is happy to assist with outreach, intros, and recruiting strategy for candidates.

#### Receiving job applications
Every job description page ends with a "call to action", including a link that candidates can click to apply for the job.  Fleet replies to all candidates within **1 business day** and always provides either a **rejection** or **decisive next steps**; even if the next step is just a promise.  For example:

> "We are still working our way through applications and _still_ have not been able to review yours yet.  We think we will be able to review and give you an update about your application by Thursday at the latest.  I'll let you know as soon as I have news.  I'll assume we're both still in the running if I don't hear from you, so please let me know if anything comes up."

When a candidate clicks applies for a job at Fleet, they are taken to a generic Typeform.  When they submit their job application, the Typeform triggers a Zapier automation that will posts the submission to `g-business-operations` in Slack.  The candidate's job application answers are then forwarded to the applicable `#hiring-xxxxx-202x` Slack channel and the hiring manager is @mentioned.

#### Candidate correspondence email templates
Fleet uses [certain email templates](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E_gTunZBMNF4AhsOFuDVi9EnvsIGbAYrmmEzdGmnc9U) when responding to candidates.  This helps us live our value of [🔴 empathy](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company#empathy) and helps the company meet the aspiration of replying to all applications within one business day.

#### Hiring restrictions

##### Incompatible former employers
Fleet maintains a list of companies with whom Fleet has do-not-solicit terms that prevents us from making offers to employees of these companies.

#### Hiring a new team member

This section is about the hiring process a new core team member, or fleetie.

> **_Note:_** _Employment classification isn't what makes someone a fleetie.  Some Fleet team members are contractors and others are employees.  The distinction between "contractor" and "employee" varies in different geographies, and the appropriate employment classification and agreement for any given team member and the place where they work is determined by Head of Business Operations during the process of making an offer._

Here are the steps hiring managers follow to get an offer out to a candidate:
1. **Add to team database:** Update the [Fleeties](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OSLn-ZCbGSjPusHPiR5dwQhheH1K8-xqyZdsOe9y7qc/edit#gid=0) doc to accurately reflect the candidate's:
   - Start date
     > _**Tip:** No need to check with the candidate if you haven't already.  Just guess.  First Mondays tend to make good start dates.  When hiring an international employee, Pilot.co recommends starting the hiring process a month before the new employee's start date._
   - First and last name
   - Preferred pronoun _("them", "her", or "him")_
   - LinkedIn URL _(If the fleetie does not have a LinkedIn account, enter `N/A`)_
   - GitHub username _(Every candidate must have a GitHub account in "Fleeties" before the company makes them an offer.  If the the candidate does not have a GitHub account, ask them to create one, and make sure it's tracked in "Fleeties".)_
     > _**Tip:** A revealing live interview question can be to ask a candidate to quickly share their screen, sign up for GitHub, and then hit the "Edit" button on one of the pages in [the Fleet handbook](https://fleetdm.com/handbook) to make their first pull request.  This should not take more than 5 minutes._
2. **Call references:** Ask the candidate for at least 2+ references and contact each reference in parallel using the instructions and tips in [Fleet's reference check template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LMOUkLJlAohuFykdgxTPL0RjAQxWkypzEYP_AT-bUAw/edit?usp=sharing).  Be respectful and keep these calls very short.
3. **Schedule CEO interview:** Book a quick chat so our CEO can get to know the future Fleetie.
   - No need to check with the CEO first.  You can [book the meeting directly](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/communications#internal-meeting-scheduling) on the CEO's calendar during a time they and the candidate are both available.
   - Make a copy of the "[¶¶ CEO interview template (questions for final interview)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yARlH6iZY-cP9cQbmL3z6TbMy-Ii7lO64RbuolpWQzI/copy)"
     - Change file name and heading of doc to "¶¶ `Canadite Name` (`Canadite Title`) <> Mike McNeil, CEO final interview (`interview date`)".
     - Add canidates personal email in the "👥" attendees section at the top of the doc.
     - add canidates [LinkedIn url](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=people&origin=HISTORY&sid=Rqe) on the first bullet for Mike.  
   - Set the Google Calendar description of the calendar event to: `Agenda: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yARlH6iZY-cP9cQbmL3z6TbMy-Ii7lO64RbuolpWQzI/copy`.
   - The personal email you use for the candidate in this calendar event is where they will receive their offer or rejection email.
5. **Confirm intent to offer:** Compile feedback about the candidate into a single document and share that document (the "interview packet") with the Head of Business Operations via Google Drive.  _This will be interpreted as a signal that you are ready for them to make an offer to this candidate._
   - _Compile feedback into a single doc:_ Include feedback from interviews, reference checks, and challenge submissions.  Include any other notes you can think of offhand, and embed links to any supporting documents that were impactful in your final decision-making, such as portfolios or challenge submissions.
   - _Share_ this single document with the Head of Business Operations via email.
     - Share only _one, single Google Doc, please_; with a short, formulaic name that's easy to understand in an instant from just an email subject line.  For example, you could title it:
       >Why hire Jane Doe ("Train Conductor") - 2023-03-21
     - When the Head of Business Operations receives this doc shared doc in their email with the compiled feedback about the candidate, they will understand that to mean that it is time for Fleet to make an offer to the candidate.

#### Making an offer
After receiving the interview packet, the Head of Business Operations uses the following steps to make an offer:
1. **Adjust compensation:** 🔦 Head of Business Operations [re-benchmarks salary](https://www.pave.com), adjusting for cost of living where the candidate will do the work.
   - _Paste a screenshot_ from Pave showing the amount of cash and equity in the offer (or write 1-2 sentences about what is being offered to this candidate and why) under the [heading for this position in " 💌 Compensation decisions"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NQ-IjcOTbyFluCWqsFLMfP4SvnopoXDcX0civ-STS5c/edit)
   - _Update the ["🥧 Equity plan"](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_GJlqnWWIQBiZFOoyl9YbTr72bg5qdSSp4O3kuKm1Jc/edit#gid=0)_ to reflect the offer that is about to be sent:
     -  Salary _(OTE actually offered)_
     -  Equity _(stock options actually offered)_
     -  "Notes" _(include base salary versus commission or bonus plan, if relevant)_
     -  "Offer sent?" _(set this to `TRUE`)_
     - …and make sure the other status columns are set to `todo`.
2. **Prepare the "exit scenarios" spreadsheet:** 🔦 Head of Business Operations [copies the "Exit scenarios (template)"](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1k2TzsFYR0QxlD-KGPxuhuvvlJMrCvLPo2z8s8oGChT0/copy) for the candidate, and renames the copy to e.g. "Exit scenarios for Jane Doe".
   - _Edit the candidate's copy of the exit scenarios spreadsheet_ to reflect the number of shares in ["🥧 Equity plan"](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_GJlqnWWIQBiZFOoyl9YbTr72bg5qdSSp4O3kuKm1Jc/edit#gid=0), and the spreadsheet will update automatically to reflect their approximate ownership percentage.
     > _**Note:** Don't play with numbers in the exit scenarios spreadsheet. The revision history is visible to the candidate, and they might misunderstand._
3. **Prepare offer:** 🔦 Head of Business Operations [copies "Offer email (template)"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zpNN2LWzAj-dVBC8iOg9jLurNlSe7XWKU69j7ntWtbY/copy) and renames to e.g. "Offer email for Jane Doe".  Edit the candidate's copy of the offer email template doc and fill in the missing information:
   - _Benefits:_ If candidate will work outside the US, [change the "Benefits" bullet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zpNN2LWzAj-dVBC8iOg9jLurNlSe7XWKU69j7ntWtbY/edit) to reflect what will be included through Fleet's international payroll provider, depending on the candidate's location.
   - _Equity:_ Highlight the number of shares with a link to the candidate's custom "exit scenarios" spreadsheet.
   - _Hand off:_ Share the offer email doc with the [Apprentice to the CEO](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/ceo#team).
4. **Draft email:** 🦿 Apprentice to the CEO drafts the offer email in the CEO's inbox, reviews one more time, and then brings it to their next daily meeting for CEO's approval:
   - To: The candidate's personal email address _(use the email from the CEO interview calendar event)_
   - Cc: Zach Wasserman and Head of Business Operations _(neither participate in the email thread until after the offer is accepted)_
   - Subject: "Full time?"
   - Body: _(The offer email is copied verbatim from Google doc into Gmail as the body of the message, formatting and all.
     - Check all links in offer letter for accuracy(e.g. LinkeIn profile of hiring manager ect.).
     - Click the surrounding areas to ensure no "ghost links" are left from previous edits... which has happened before.
     - Re-read the offer email one last time, and especially double-check that salary, number of shares, and start date match the equity plan.)_
5. **Send offer:** 🐈‍⬛ CEO reviews and sends the offer to the candidate:
   - _Grant the candidate "edit" access_ to their "exit scenarios" spreadsheet.
   - _Send_ the email.

#### Steps after an offer is accepted

Once the new team member replies and accepts their offer in writing, 🔦 Head of Business Operations follows these steps:
1. **Verify, track, and reply:** Reply to the candidate:
   - _Verify the candidate replied with their physical address… or else keep asking._  If they did not reply with their physical address, then we are not done.  No offer is "accepted" until we've received a physical address.
   - _Review and update the team database_ to be sure everything is accurate, **one last time**.  Remember to read the column headers and precisely follow the instructions about how to format the data:
     - The new team member's role in ["🧑‍🚀 Fleeties"](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OSLn-ZCbGSjPusHPiR5dwQhheH1K8-xqyZdsOe9y7qc/edit#gid=0) now includes:
       - **Start date** _(The new fleetie's first day, YYYY-MM-DD)_
       - **Location** _(Derive this from the physical address)_
       - **GitHub username**  _(Username of 2FA-enabled GitHub account)_
       - **@fleetdm.com email** _(Set this to whatever email you think this person should have)_
     - The new team member's row in ["🥧 Equity plan"](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_GJlqnWWIQBiZFOoyl9YbTr72bg5qdSSp4O3kuKm1Jc/edit#gid=0) now includes:
       - **OTE** _("On-target earnings", i.e. anticipated total annual cash compensation)_
       - **Equity** _(Stock options)_
       - **"Notes"** _(Track base salary here, as well as a very short explanation of commission or bonus structure.)_
       - **Physical address** _(The full street address of the location where work will typically be performed.)_
       - **Personal email** _(Use the personal email they're replying from, e.g. `@gmail.com`)_
       - **"Offer accepted?"** _(Set this to `TRUE`)_
   - _[Create a "Hiring" issue](https://github.com/fleetdm/confidential/issues/new/choose)_ for the new team member.  (This issue will keep track of the hiring tasks for the new team member.)
   - _Send a reply_ welcoming the team member to Fleet and letting them know to expect a separate email with next steps for getting the team member's laptop, Yubikeys, and agreement going ASAP so they can start on time.  For example:
     ```
     \o/  It's official!
     
     Be on the lookout for an email in a separate thread with next steps for quickly signing the paperwork and getting your company laptop and hardware 2FA keys (Yubikeys), which we recommend setting up ASAP.
     
     Thanks, and welcome to the team!
     
     -Joanne
     ```
2. **Ask hiring manager to send rejections:** Post to the `hiring-xxxxx-yyyy` Slack channel to let folks know the offer was accepted, and at-mention the _hiring manager_ to ask them to communicate with [all other interviewees](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company#empathy) who are still in the running and [let them know that we chose a different person](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/business-operations#candidate-correspondence-email-templates).
   >_**Note:** Send rejection emails quickly, within 1 business day.  It only gets harder if you wait._
3. **Remove open position:** Take down the newly-filled position from the fleetdm.com website by making the following two changes:  (please only submit [one, single pull request that changes both of these files](https://www.loom.com/share/75da64632a93415cbe0e7752107c1af2):
   - Edit the [list of open positions](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company#open-positions) to remove the newly-filled position from the list.
   - Remove the [job description file](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/tree/main/handbook/company) that corresponds with the newly-filled position.  (This is a Markdown file named after the role, with a filename ending in `.md`.)
5. **Close Slack channel:** Then archive and close the channel.

Now what happens?  🔦 Business Operations will then follow the steps in the "Hiring" issue, which includes reaching out to the new team member within 1 business day from a separate email thread to get additional information as needed, prepare their agreement, add them to the company's payroll system, and get their new laptop and hardware security keys ordered so that everything is ready for them to start on their first day.

## Departures

### Communicating departures
Although it's sad to see someone go, Fleet understands that not everything is meant to be forever [like open-source is](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/why-this-way#why-open-source). There are a few steps that the company needs to take to facilitate a departure. 
1. **Departing team member's manager:** Before speaking further with the team member, inform business operations about the departure via direct message in Slack to the acting Head of People (`@mikermcneil`), who will coordinate the team member's last day, offboarding, and exit meeting.
2. **Business Operations**: Create and begin completing [offboarding issue](https://github.com/fleetdm/classified/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/%F0%9F%9A%AA-offboarding-____________.md).
   > After finding out at the next standup (or sooner), Business Operations will post in `#g-e` to inform the E-group of the team member's departure and ask E-group members will inform any other managers on their teams.
3. **CEO**: The CEO will make an announcement during the "🌈 Weekly Update" post on Friday in the `#general` channel on Slack.
