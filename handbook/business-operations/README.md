# Business Operations


## Meetings
* At Fleet, meetings start whether you're there or not. Nevertheless, being even a few minutes late can make a big difference and slow your meeting counterparts down. When in doubt, show up a couple of minutes early.
* It's okay to spend the first minute or two of a meeting being present and making small talk. Since we are all remote, it's easy to miss out on hallway chatter and human connections that happen in [meatspace](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/meatspace).  Use this time together during the first minute to say "Hi!"  Then you can jump into the topics to be discussed.
* Turning on your camera allows for more complete and intuitive verbal and non-verbal communication. Feel free to leave your camera on or turn it off when joining meetings with new participants you might not be familiar with yet. Turn your camera on when you lead or cohost a meeting.
* In an all-remote company, “face time” matters. Remember: even if someone’s calendar is open, they have other work to do. Limiting (or batching up) internal meetings can enable longer, uninterrupted stretches of deep work.

### Internal meeting scheduling
Use the Google Calendar "[Find a meeting time](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37161?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop#zippy=%2Cfind-a-meeting-time)" feature to coordinate meetings with Fleet team members. Enter the `@fleetdm.com` emails for each
participant into the "Meet with..." box in Google Calendar, and the calendar availability for each
participant will appear in your view. Then, when you select a meeting time, those participants will
automatically be invited, and a video conference will be attached to the invite.
Please prefer this strategy over negotiating meeting times via chat -- This can save a lot of
communication overhead, especially when scheduling with multiple participants.
It is important to [set your working
hours](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/7638168?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop) in
Google Calendar and block out any personal time/events/PTO, so that team members do not inadvertently
schedule a time when you are not available. Many team members use the free tier of
[reclaim.ai](https://reclaim.ai/) to synchronize personal event times (without event details) into
their work calendars. It is also common practice to block out time for focused work.

### Modifying an event organized by someone else
To edit an event where someone else at Fleet is the organizer, you can first subscribe to their calendar in Google Calendar and then edit the event on their calendar.  Your edits will automatically apply to all attendees.
> This works because every Fleetie grants edit access to everyone else at Fleet as part of onboarding.

### External meeting scheduling
When scheduling external meetings, provide external participants with a
[Calendly](https://calendly.com) link to schedule with the relevant internal participants. If you
need a Calendly account, reach out to `mikermcneil` via Slack.

### Scheduling a Zoom meeting
We use the Zoom add-on for Google Calendar to schedule Zoom meetings when we create calendar events. To add a Zoom meeting to a calendar event, click the "Add video conferencing" dropdown and select "Zoom Meeting." Google Calendar will automatically add the Zoom meeting details and instructions to join the event.
We configure our Zoom meetings to let participants join before the host starts the meeting. We do this to make sure meetings start on time, even if the host isn't there.

### Key reviews
Every release cycle, each department leader prepares a [key review deck](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/key-review/#purpose) and presents it to the CEO. In this deck, the department will highlight KPI metrics (numbers measuring everyday excellence) and progress of timebound goals for a particular quarter (OKRs). The information for creating this deck is located in the ["🌈 Fleet" Google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lizTSi7YotG_zA7zJeHuOXTg_KF1Ji8k) using ["How to create key review"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PDwJL0HiCz-KbEGZMfldAYX_aLk5OVAU1MMSgMYYF2A/edit?usp=sharing)(internal doc).


## Spending company money
As we continue to expand our company policies, we use [GitLab's open expense policy](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/spending-company-money/) as a guide for company spending.
In brief, this means that as a Fleet team member, you may:
* Spend company money like it is your own money.
* Be responsible for what you need to purchase or expense to do your job effectively.
* Feel free to make purchases __in the company's interest__ without asking for permission beforehand (when in doubt, do __inform__ your manager prior to purchase or as soon as possible after the purchase).
For more developed thoughts about __spending guidelines and limits__, please read [GitLab's open expense policy](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/spending-company-money/).

### Attending conferences or company travel
When attending a conference or traveling for Fleet, please make a post in [#help-brex](https://fleetdm.slack.com/archives/C0396TYH4EP) on Slack with the following information:
- The start and end dates for your trip.
- The price of your flight (feel free to optimize a direct flight if there is one that is less than double the price of the cheapest non-direct flight).
- The price of your hotel per night (dry cleaning is allowable if the stay is over 3 days).
- The price of the admission fees if attending a conference.
- $100 allowance per day for food and beverage **(please use your personal credit card for movies, mini bars, and entertainment, except when entertaining guests who contribute actively in code/community on a quarterly basis, or who are Salesforce contacts on an open, qualified opportunity with a budget of at least $160k+ ΔARR)**.
- Customer/Partner Facing Events:
  - Gala/Black Tie Events: Tuxedo or Gown Rental, $150-$225 USD per event is reimbursable. **(The event must be customer specific and the invitation must state black tie only)**.
The monthly limit on your Brex card will be increased temporarily as necessary to accommodate the increased spending associated with the conference.
We highly recommend you order a physical Brex card if you do not have one before attending the conference.

### Non-travel purchases that exceed a Brex cardholder's limit
For non-travel purchases that would require an increase in the Brex cardholder's limit, please make a post in [#g-business-opeartions](https://fleetdm.slack.com/archives/C047N5L6EGH)) on Slack with the following information:
- The nature of the purchase (i.e. SaaS subscription and what it's used for)
- The cost of the purchase and whether it is a fixed or variable (i.e. use-based) cost.
- Whether it is a one time purchase or a recurring purchase and at what frequency the purchase will re-occur (annually, monthly, etc.)
- If there are more ideal options to pay for the purchase (i.e. bill.com, the Fleet AP Brex card, etc.) that method will be used instead.  
- In general, recurring purchases such as subscription services that will continually stretch the spend limit on a cardholder's Brex card should be paid through other means. 
- For one time purchases where payment via credit card is the most convenient then the card limit will be temporarily increased to accomodate the purchase.  

### Reimbursements
We provide all of our team members with Brex cards for making purchases for the company. Fleet will reimburse team members who pay for work-related expenses with their personal funds.
Team members can request reimbursement through [Gusto]([https://app.gusto.com/expenses](https://support.gusto.com/article/209831449100000/Get-reimbursed-for-expenses-as-an-employee)) if they're in the US or [Pilot]([https://pilot.co/](https://help.pilot.co/en/articles/4658204-how-to-request-a-reimbursement#:~:text=If%20you%20made%20a%20purchase,and%20click%20'Add%20new%20expense.)) if they are an international team member. When submitting an expense report, team members need to provide the receipt and a description of the expense.
Operations will review the expense and reach out to the team member if they have any questions. The reimbursement will be added to the team member's next payroll when an expense is approved.
>Pilot handles reimbursements differently depending on if the international team member is classified as an employee or a contractor. If the reimbursement is for a contractor, Operations will need to add the expense reimbursement to an upcoming recurring payment or schedule the reimbursement as an off-cycle payment. If the reimbursement is for an employee, no other action is needed; Pilot will add the reimbursement to the team member's next payroll. 


## Benefits

### Coworking
Your Brex card may be used for up to $500 USD per month in coworking costs. Please get prior approval from your manager. Once approved, get started by reaching out to Mike McNeil via direct message in Slack.

### Paid time off
What matters most is your results, which are driven by your focus, your availability to collaborate, and the time and consideration you put into your work. Fleet offers all team members unlimited time off. Whether you're sick, you want to take a trip, you are eager for some time to relax, or you need to get some chores done around the house, any reason is a good reason.
For team members working in jurisdictions that require certain mandatory sick leave or PTO policies, Fleet complies to the extent required by law.

### Taking time off
When you take any time off, you should follow this process:
- Let your manager and team know as soon as possible (i.e., post a message in your team's Slack channel with when and how long).
- Find someone to cover anything that needs covering while you're out and communicate what they need to take over the responsibilities as well as who to refer to for help (e.g., meetings, planned tasks, unfinished business, important Slack/email threads, anything where someone might be depending on you).
- Mark an all-day "Out of office" event in Google Calendar for the day(s) you're taking off.
If you can’t complete the above because you need to take the day off quickly due to an emergency, let your manager know and they will help you complete the handoff.
If you ever want to take a day off, and the only thing stopping you is internal (Fleetie-only) meetings, don’t stress. Consider, “Is this a meeting that I can reschedule to another day, or is this a meeting that can go on without me and not interfere with the company’s plans?” Talk to your manager if you’re unsure, but it is perfectly OK to reschedule internal meetings that can wait so that you can take a day off.
This process is the same for any days you take off, whether it's a holiday or you just need a break.
   
### Holidays
At Fleet, we have team members with various employment classifications in many different countries worldwide. Fleet is a US company, but we think you should choose the days you want to work and what days you are on holiday, rather than being locked into any particular nation or culture's expectation about when to take time off.
When a team member joins Fleet, they pick one of the following holiday schedules:
 - **Traditional**: This is based on the country where you work. Non-US team members should let their managers know the dates of national holidays.
 **Or**
 - **Freestyle**: You have no set schedule and start with no holidays. Then you add the days that are holidays to you.

Either way, it's up to you to make sure that your responsibilities are covered, and that your team knows you're out of the office.

### New parent leave
Fleet gives new parents six weeks of paid leave. After six weeks, if you don't feel ready to return yet, we'll set up a quick call to discuss and work together to come up with a plan to help you return to work gradually or when you're ready.

### Relocating
When Fleeties relocate there are vendors that need to be notified of the change. 

Team member directions:
  - Please follow the directions listed in the ["Moving" template](https://github.com/fleetdm/confidential/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/x-moving.md) to create a confidential issue and assign to the [🔦#g-business-operations kanban (project) board](https://github.com/orgs/fleetdm/projects/51/views/1).


## Performance feedback
At Fleet, performance feedback is a continuous process. We give feedback (particularly negative) as soon as possible. Most feedback will happen during 1:1 meetings, if not sooner.


## Compensation changes
Fleet's founders [evaluate and update compensation decisions yearly](#workiversaries), shortly after the anniversary of a team member's start date.


## CEO handbook
The [CEO handbook](./ceo-handbook.md) details processes specific to Mike McNeil, CEO of Fleet. 


## Open positions

Please see [handbook/company#open-positions](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company#open-positions) for a list of open job postings at Fleet.

## Team member onboarding

### Training
It's [important](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/why-this-way#why-the-emphasis-on-training) that every team member at Fleet takes the time to get fully trained and onboarded. 
When a new team member joins Fleet, we create an onboarding issue for them in the [fleetdm/confidential](https://github.com/fleetdm/confidential) repo using this [issue template](https://github.com/fleetdm/confidential/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/onboarding.md). 
We want to make sure that the new team member will be able to complete every task in their issue. To make sure the new team member is successful in their onboarding, we customize their issue by commenting on any tasks they won't need to complete.
We believe in taking onboarding and training seriously and that the onboarding template is an essential source of truth and good use of time for every single new hire. If managers see a step that they don't feel is necessary, they should make a pull request to the [onboarding template](https://github.com/fleetdm/confidential/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/onboarding.md).

Expectations during onboarding:
- Onboarding time (all checkboxes checked) is a KPI for the business operations team.  Our goal is 14 days or less.
- The first 3 weekdays (excluding days off) for **every new team member** at Fleet is reserved for completing onboarding tasks from the checkboxes in their onboarding issue.  New team members **should not work on anything else during this time**, whether or not other tasks are stacking up or assigned.  It is OK, expected, and appreciated for new team members to **remind their manager and colleagues** of this [important](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/why-this-way#why-the-emphasis-on-training) responsibility.
- Even after the first 3 days, during the rest of their first 2 weeks, completing onboarding tasks on time is a new team member's [highest priority](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/why-this-way#why-the-emphasis-on-training).


### Sightseeing tour
During their onboarding at Fleet, new team members are asked to schedule a sightseeing tour call with People operations. During this call, the new team member will participate in an interactive tour that includes:
- GitHub issues: the living bloodstream of the company.
- Kanban boards: the bulletin board of quests you can get and how you update status and let folks know things are done.
- Google Calendar: the future.
- Gmail: like any mailbox, full of junk mail, plus some important things, so it is important to check carefully.
- Salesforce: the Rolodex.
- Google Docs: the archives.
- Slack:
  - The "office" (#g-, #general).
  - The walkie talkies (DMs).
  - The watering hole (#oooh-, #random, #news, #help-).

### Contributor experience training
During their first week at Fleet, new team members are asked to schedule a contributor experience training call with Mike McNeil. During this call, the new team member will share their screen, and People operations will:
- make sure emails will get seen and responded to quickly.
- make sure Slack messages will get seen and responded to quickly.
- make sure you know where your issues are tracked, which kanban board you use, and what the columns mean.
- make sure you can succeed with submitting a PR with the GitHub web editor, modifying docs or handbook, and working with Markdown.
- talk about Google calendar.
- give you a quick tour of the Fleet Google drive folder.


### Directly responsible individuals
Please read ["Why direct responsibility?"](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/why-this-way#why-direct-responsibility) to learn more about DRIs.


### Levels of confidentiality

- *Public*   _(share with anyone, anywhere in the world)_
- *Confidential*  _(share only with team members who've signed an NDA, consulting agreement, or employment agreement)_
- *Classified*  _(share only with founders of Fleet, peepops, and/or the people involved.  e.g., US social security numbers during hiring)_


### Email relays

There are several special email addresses that automatically relay messages to the appropriate people at Fleet. Each email address meets a minimum response time ("Min RT"), expressed in business hours/days, and has a dedicated, directly responsible individual (DRI) who is responsible for reading and replying to emails sent to that address.  You can see a list of those email addresses in ["Contacting Fleet" (private Google doc)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tE-NpNfw1icmU2MjYuBRib0VWBPVAdmq4NiCrpuI0F0/edit#).

### GitHub labels

We use special characters to define different types of GitHub labels. By combining labels, we
organize and categorize GitHub issues. This reduces the total number of labels required while
maintaining an expressive labeling system. For example, instead of a label called
`platform-dev-backend`, we use `#platform :dev ~backend`.

| Special character | Label type  | Examples                            |
|:------------------|:------------|:------------------------------------|
| `#`               | Noun        | `#platform`, `#interface`, `#agent`
| `:`               | Verb        | `:dev`, `:research`, `:design`
| `~`               | Adjective   | `~blocked`, `~frontend`, `~backend`



## Tools we use

There are a number of tools that are used throughout Fleet. Some of these tools are used company-wide, while others are department-specific. You can see a list of those tools in ["Tools we use" (private Google doc)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/170qjzvyGjmbFhwS4Mucotxnw_JvyAjYv4qpwBrS6Gl8/edit?usp=sharing).

Here is an overview of a few of the most important and generally-applicable tools we use at Fleet:

### Slack
At Fleet, we do not send internal emails to each other. Instead, we prefer to use Slack to communicate with other folks who work at Fleet.
We use threads in Slack as much as possible. Threads help limit noise for other people following the channel and reduce notification overload.
We configure our [working hours in Slack](https://slack.com/help/articles/360025054173-Set-up-Slack-for-work-hours-) to make sure everyone knows when they can get in touch with others.

#### Slack channel prefixes
We have specific channels for various topics, but we also have more general channels for the teams at Fleet.
We use these prefixes to organize the Fleet Slack:
 * ***g-***: for team/group channels *(Note: "g-" is short for "grupo" or "group")*.
 * ***oooh-***: used to discuss and share interesting information about a topic.
 * ***help-***: for asking for help on specific topics.
 * ***at*** or ***fleet-at***: for customer channels.
 * ***2023-***: for temporary channels _(Note: specify the relevant year in four digits, like "YYYY-`)_

#### Slack communications and best practices
In consideration of our team, Fleet avoids using global tags in channels (i.e. @here, @channel, etc). 
      1. What about polls? Good question, Fleeties are asked to post their poll in the channel and @mention the teammates they would like to hear from. 
      2. Why does this matter? Great question! The Fleet [culture](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company#culture) is pretty simple: think of others, and remember the company [Values](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company#values).


### Zoom
We use [Zoom](https://zoom.us) for virtual meetings at Fleet, and it is important that every team member feels comfortable hosting, joining, and scheduling Zoom meetings.
By default, Zoom settings are the same for all Fleet team members, but you can change your personal settings on your [profile settings](https://zoom.us/profile/setting) page. 
Settings that have a lock icon next to them have been locked by an administrator and cannot be changed. Zoom administrators can change settings for all team members on the [account settings page](https://zoom.us/account/setting) or for individual accounts on the [user management page](https://zoom.us/account/user#/).


### Salesforce 
We consider Salesforce to be our Rolodex for customer information. During the onboarding process, you may need to add a license for the new hire. Here are the steps we take: 
1. Go to “Your account.”
2. View contracts -> pick current contract.
3. Add the number of licenses.
4. Sign DocuSign sent to the email.
5. The order will be processed in ~30m.

### Gong
Capturing video from meetings with customers, prospects, and community members outside the company is an important part of building world-class sales and customer success teams and is a widespread practice across the industry. At Fleet, we use Gong to capture Zoom meetings and share them company-wide. If a team member with a Gong license attends certain meetings, generally those with at least one person from outside of Fleet in attendance.  
  - While some Fleeties may have a Gong seat that is necessary in their work, the typical use case at Fleet is for employees on the company's sales, customer success, or customer support teams. 
  - You should be notified anytime you join a recorded call with an audio message announcing "this meeting is being recorded" or "recording in progress."  To stop a recording, the host of the call can press "Stop." 
  - If the call has external participants and is recorded, this call is stored in Gong for future use. 
To access a recording saved in Gong, visit [app.gong.io](app.gong.io) and sign in with SSO. 
  - Everyone at Fleet has access, whether they have a Gong seat or not, and you can explore and search through any uploaded call transcripts unless someone marks them as private (though the best practice would be not to record any calls you don't want to be captured). 
If you ever make a mistake and need to delete something, you can delete the video in Gong or reach out to Nathan Holliday or Mike McNeil for help. They will delete it immediately without watching the video. 
  - Note that any recording stopped within 60 seconds of the start of the recording is not saved in Gong, and there will be no saved record of it. 

Most folks at Fleet should see no difference in their meetings if they aren't interfacing with external parties. 
Our goal in using Gong and recording calls is to capture insights from sales, customer, and community meetings and improve how we position and sell our product. We never intend to make anyone uncomfortable, and we hope you reach out to our DRI for Gong, Nathan Holliday, or Mike McNeil if you have questions or concerns.  

Troubleshooting Gong:
  - In order to use Gong, the Zoom call must be hosted by someone with a Fleet email address.  
    - You cannot use Gong to record calls hosted by external parties.
  - Cloud recording in Zoom has to be turned on and unlocked company wide for Gong to function properly, because of this, there is a chance that some Gong recordings may still save in Zoom's cloud storage even if they aren't uploaded into Gong.
    - To counter this, Nathan Holliday will periodically delete all recordings found in Zoom's storage without viewing them.
  - For those with a Gong seat or scheduling a call with someone in attendance that has a Gong seat who does not wish for their Zoom call with an external party to record:
    - A complete list can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OOxLajvqf-on5I8viN7k6aCzqEWS2B24_mE47OefutE/edit?usp=sharing).
      - 1 on 1, 1:1, confidential, interview, internal and no shadows are some commonly used words that will disable Gong.   
    - If you need words added to the list of exlusionary words, please reach out to Nathan Holliday.
  - We have excluded anyone with an email domain from @cooley.com or @pilot.com from Gong's recording feature. These are professional services firms working with Fleet on internal matters, and calls with them are considered internal. 

>If you need help using Gong, please check out Gong Academy at [https://academy.gong.io/](https://academy.gong.io/).

### Zapier and DocuSign
We use Zapier to automate how completed DocuSign envelopes are formatted and stored. This process ensures we store signed documents in the correct folder and that filenames are formatted consistently. 
When the final signature is added to an envelope in DocuSign, it is marked as completed and sent to Zapier, where it goes through these steps:
1. Zapier sends the following information about the DocuSign envelope to our Hydroplane webhook:
   - **`emailSubject`** - The subject of the envelope sent by DocuSign. Our DocuSign templates are configured to format the email subject as `[type of document] for [signer's name]`.
   - **`emailCsv`** - A comma-separated list of signers' email addresses.
2. The Hydroplane webhook matches the document type to the correct Google Drive folder, orders the list of signers, creates a timestamp, and sends that data back to Zapier as
   - **`destinationFolderID`** - The slug for the Google Drive folder where we store this type of document.
   - **`emailCsv`** - A sorted list of signers' email addresses.
   - **`date`** - The date the document was completed in DocuSign, formatted YYYY-MM-DD.
3. Zapier uses this information to upload the file to the matched Google Drive folder, with the filename formatted as `[date] - [emailSubject] - [emailCvs].PDF`.
4. Once the file is uploaded, Zapier uses the Slack integration to post in the #peepops channel with the message:
   ```
   Now complete with all signatures:
      [email subject]
      link: drive.google.com/[destinationFolderID]
   ```



## Hiring

> Are you a new fleetie joining the Business Operations team?  For Loom recordings demonstrating how to make offers, hire, onboard, and more please see [this classified Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fimxQguPOtK-2YLAVjWRNCYqs5TszAHJslhtT_23Ly0/edit).

### Creating a new position
Every new position being created goes through this process before interviewing, accepting applicants, or extending offers.

> If you think this job posting may need to stay temporarily classified (¶¶) and not shared company-wide or publicly yet, for any reason, then stop here and send a Slack DM with your proposal to the CEO instead of modifying "🧑‍🚀 Fleeties" (which is visible company-wide) or submitting a draft pull request to "Open positions" (which is public).

1. **Propose headcount:** Add the proposed position to ["🧑‍🚀 Fleeties"](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OSLn-ZCbGSjPusHPiR5dwQhheH1K8-xqyZdsOe9y7qc/edit#gid=0) in an empty row (but using one of the existing IDs.  Unsure?  Ask for help.)  Be sure to include job title, manager, and department.  For now, leave the start date blank.
2. **Propose job description:** Locate one of the existing job descriptions inside the `handbook/company/` folder and duplicate it into a new handbook subpage.  Use the same style of filename, but based on the new job title.  (This filename will determine the URL where candidates can apply.)
  a. Keep the structure of the document identical.  Change only the job title, "Responsibilities", and "Experience".
  b. In the same pull request, add a link to your new job to the bottom of ["📖 Company#Open positions"](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company#open-positions) in the handbook.

5. new job description for  by duplicating a new Markdown file based on one of the other open job listings (or past listings, from the commit history).   Then edit the "Open positions" section of the "Company" handbook page to add a new bullet at the bottom of the existing bullet point list.  State the proposed job title, include the appropriate departmental emoji, and then wrap it in a link and point it at the "living" subpage for the new job description.  Use the "living" fleetdm.com URL; not the GitHub URL.  (This is where the new page _will eventually exist_, once this pull request is merged.  For now, if you were to visit this URL, you'd just see a 404 error.  So how can you determine this URL?  To understand the pattern, visit other job description pages from the [live handbook](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company#open-positions), and examine their URLs in your browser.)
6. **Get it approved and merged:**  When you submit your proposed job description, the CEO will be automatically tagged for review and get a notification.  He will consider where this role fits into Fleet's strategy and decide whether Fleet will open this position at this time.  He will review the data carefully to try and catch any simple mistakes, then tentatively budget cash and equity compensation and document this compensation research.  He will set a tentative start date (which also indicates this position is no longer just "proposed"; it's now part of the hiring plan.)  Then the CEO will reply promptly in the `#hiring-xxxxx-YYYY` Slack channel, at-mentioning the original proposer and letting them know their position is approved.  (Unless it isn't.)

> #### Steps for Mike
>  - Confirm the new row in "Fleeties" has a manager, job title, and department, that it doesn't have any corrupted spreadsheet formulas or formatting, and that the start date is still blank (so that it is clear to everyone that this position has been proposed, but that it is not confirmed and planned, yet).
>  - Confirm the job description consists only of changes to "Responsibilities" and "Experience," with an appropriate filename, and that the content looks accurate, is grammatically correct, and is otherwise ready to post in a public job description on fleetdm.com.  Then approve and merge the pull request.
>  - Ballpark, budget, and document compensation research for the role
>    - Scroll to the very bottom of ["¶¶ 💌 Compensation decisions (offer math)"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NQ-IjcOTbyFluCWqsFLMfP4SvnopoXDcX0civ-STS5c/edit#heading=h.slomq4whmyas) and add a new heading for the role, pattern-matching off of the names of other nearby role headings.
>    - Use [Pave](https://pave.com) to determine anticipated compensation in terms of base salary, variable compensation, and equity, then write those ballpark compensation numbers under the new heading in "Compensation decisions".  (Write equity as a percentage.  And when ballparking salary, err on the side of the role costing more.)
>    - Then create written documentation of your research for future reference.  Take a screenshot of the relevant Pave screens and paste those screenshots under the new heading.
>  - Update the row in ["¶¶ 🥧 Equity plan"](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_GJlqnWWIQBiZFOoyl9YbTr72bg5qdSSp4O3kuKm1Jc/edit#gid=0) using the benchmarked compensation and share count.
>    - Note: Most columns of the equity plan are updated automatically when Fleeties is, based on the unique identifier of each row, like `🧑‍🚀890`.  (Advisors have their own flavor of unique IDs, such as `🦉755`.)
>    - Enter the salary: If the role has variable compensation, use the role's OTE (on-target earning estimate) as the budgeted salary amount, and leave a note in the "Notes (¶¶)" cell clarifying the role's bonus or commission structure.
>    - Enter the equity as a number of shares, watching the percentage that is automatically calculated in the next cell.  Keep guessing different numbers of shares until you get the derived percentage looking like what you want to see.
>  - Create a private "#hiring-xxxxxx-YYYY" Slack channel (where "xxxxxx" is the job title and YYYY is the current year).
>    - Invite the hiring manager.  (Mike McNeil is the DRI for all `#hiring-xxxxx-2022` Slack channels, but the hiring manager is also included.)
>    - In the channel, post a message at-mentioning the hiring manager to let them know that their proposed position has been reviewed and approved, and now the job description and application form are live on the website.  Include a direct link to their live job description on fleetdm.com.  (This is the URL where candidates can go to read about the job and apply.  For example: `fleetdm.com/handbook/company/product-designer`)




### Receiving job applications
Every job description page ends with a "call to action", including a link that candidates can click to apply for the job.  Fleet replies to all candidates within **1 business day** and always provides either a **rejection** or **decisive next steps**; even if the next step is just a promise.  For example:

> "We are still working our way through applications and _still_ have not been able to review yours yet.  We think we will be able to review and give you an update about your application update by Thursday at the latest.  I'll let you know as soon as I have news.  I'll assume we're both still in the running if I don't hear from you, so please let me know if anything comes up."


When a candidate clicks applies for a job at Fleet, they are taken to a generic Typeform.  When they submit their job application, the Typeform triggers a Zapier automation that will posts the submission to `g-business-operations` in Slack.  The candidate's job application answers are then forwarded to the applicable `#hiring-xxxxx-202x` Slack channel and the hiring manager is @mentioned.

### Recruiting
#### Checking legal restrictions on hiring
Fleet maintains a list of companies with whom Fleet has do-not-solicit terms that prevents us from making offers to employees of these companies.  The list is in the Do Not Solicit tab of the [BizOps spreadhseet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lp3OugxfPfMjAgQWRi_rbyL_3opILq-duHmlng_pwyo/edit#gid=0).


### Interviewing at Fleet
We're glad you're interested in joining the team! 
Here are some of the things you can anticipate throughout this process:
  - We will reply by email within one business day from the time when the application arrives.
  - You may receive a rejection email (Bummer, consider applying again in the future).
  - You may receive an invitation to "book with us."
If you've been invited to "book with us," you'll have a Zoom meeting with the hiring team to discuss the next steps. 

### Candidate correspondence email templates
[We use email templates]([url](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E_gTunZBMNF4AhsOFuDVi9EnvsIGbAYrmmEzdGmnc9U)) to meet our commitment of replying to all applications within one business day.

### Hiring a new team member
> Fleet is unable to hire team members in some countries. See [this internal document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jHHJqShIyvlVwzx1C-FB9GC74Di_Rfdgmhpai1SPC0g/edit) for the list.
1. **Manager:** At-mention Mike McNeil in the `#hiring-xxxxx-2022` channel and indicate that you would like for Fleet to make an offer to the candidate.  Include the candidate's name, personal email address, the timeframe for their start date, and the country where they will be working. 
2. **People Ops:** Mike McNeil will research compensation using [Pave](https://www.pave.com), making sure to adjust for the cost of living where the candidate will do the work. Mike McNeil will then document this decision in the [compensation decisions document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NQ-IjcOTbyFluCWqsFLMfP4SvnopoXDcX0civ-STS5c/edit) for future reference.
3. **People Ops:** After you have determined compensation, make copies of these two templates and customize them for this candidate:
   - [Exit scenarios (template)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1k2TzsFYR0QxlD-KGPxuhuvvlJMrCvLPo2z8s8oGChT0/copy)
   - [Informal offer email (template)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zpNN2LWzAj-dVBC8iOg9jLurNlSe7XWKU69j7ntWtbY/copy)
Change the name of the copied documents accordingly (e.g., "[candidate's name]'s a copy of exit scenarios") and link to the exit scenarios spreadsheet from the offer email.
4. **People Ops:** Next, prepare the informal offer email. Post in the `#g-people` Slack channel and at-mention the CEO for assistance with determining the number of shares.  You'll then need to add the following information to the template: 
   - Candidate's name and email address
   - Candidate's start date
   - Candidate's compensation
   - Candidate's manager (the person they report to)
   - Equity offered to the candidate (specify the number of shares, and highlight it with a link to the candidate's exit scenarios spreadsheet)
   - Benefits (determined by the candidate's location)
5. **People Ops:** Prepare the exit scenarios spreadsheet. Enter the number of shares offered to the candidate, and the spreadsheet will update to reflect this. 
      >**_Note:_** *Don't play with numbers in the exit scenarios spreadsheet. The revision history is visible to the candidate, and they might misunderstand.*
6. **People Ops:** Once both documents are complete, share the offer email draft, exit scenarios copy, and a link to the compensation decision with the CEO for approval by mentioning @mikermcneil in #g-people.
7. **CEO:** Confirm:
  - The compensation decision has been documented sufficiently and adjusted for the cost of living.
  - The equity plan and budget are up to date with the actual offer that is about to be sent.
  - The Fleeties doc now reflects the actual start date from the offer email, as well as the candidate's name, LinkedIn URL, and preferred pronoun.
  - It still makes business sense to make this offer by reviewing the budget and equity plan.
The CEO will then reply in `#g-people` to indicate that the offer is approved.
   >**_Note:_** *When hiring an international employee, Pilot.co recommends starting the hiring process a month before the new employee's start date.*
8. **People Ops:** After obtaining CEO approval, confirm everything is correct one more time, then mention the CEO or CTO, who will send the offer email.
  - The offer email is copied directly from Google Drive into Gmail before being sent to the candidate.
  - When sending the offer, the CEO or CTO will edit the permissions of the exit scenarios sheet so it is accessible to the candidate.
  - People Ops is cc'd on the offer email but will not participate in the email thread until after the offer is accepted.

#### Hiring a new consultant

> The words "consultant" and "contractor" are used interchangably, where appropriate.
> Some Fleet team members are contractors and others are employees.

Consultant agreements are sent through [DocuSign](https://www.docusign.com/), using the "Consulting Agreement" template. To send a new consulting agreement, you'll need the new consultant's name, the term of the service, a summary of the services provided, and the consultant's fee. 
There are some defaults that we use for these agreements:
   - Term: one month
   - Services rendered: [use this doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b5SGgYEHqDmq5QF8p29WWN3it3XJh3xRT3zG0RdXARo/edit)
   - Work will commence and complete by dates: Start date and end of term date
   - Fee: Get from the contractor
   - Hours: Default to 10 hr/week - 40 hr/week
Then hit send!  After all of the signatures are there, the completed document will automatically be uploaded to the appropriate Google Drive folder, and a Slack message will appear in the `#g-people` channel.


### Steps after an offer is accepted
1. Once an applicant accepts an offer in writing, Mike McNeil replies to the candidate.
2. Mike McNeil creates a [hiring issue](https://github.com/fleetdm/confidential/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/hiring.md) for the new team member in the [fleetdm/confidential](https://github.com/fleetdm/confidential/issues) repo. People Ops will use this issue to keep track of the hiring tasks for the new team member.
3. Mike McNeil reaches out to the new team member via email to get any information they will need to prepare an agreement and add them to our payroll system.
   - **US team members**: Mike McNeil will send the new team member's agreement through [DocuSign](https://www.docusign.com/).
  After signing and storing an in the correct Google Drive folder, Mike McNeil will invite the new team member to onboard in [Gusto](https://www.gusto.com/). Mike McNeil will reach out to them if the new team member is a W-2 employee and schedule an I-9 verification meeting.
   >*If we're hiring in a new state, we'll have to register for state taxes and unemployment. Gusto usually handles this process.*
   - **For international team members:** Mike McNeil enters the new team member's information into [Pilot](https://pilot.co/) to kick off their hiring process. Pilot creates an agreement for the new team member, and People Ops reviews it to make sure everything looks correct. After Mike McNeil confirms the information about the new hire, Pilot invites the new team member to enter the rest of their information and informs Mike McNeil via email when a new Fleetie signs their agreement.
4. **As soon as we have a signed agreement with a new team member:** Mike McNeil reaches out to the new team member to provide them with a [work device](#purchasing-a-company-issued-device) and a pair of [YubiKeys](./../security.md#hardware-security-keys). Mike McNeil then requests a screenshot or link to the new Fleetie's preferred device and configuration. People Ops orders their device and Yubikeys using his Brex card and has them shipped directly to the new team member.
   >*If the new team member is in the US and requests a MacBook, It will be purchased using our Apple business account. For MacBooks purchased with this account, Apple will ship pre-configured and enrolled in our MDM.*
5. **Two weeks before their first day at Fleet:** Mike McNeil creates a [Google Workspace account](https://admin.google.com/ac/users) for the new team member and invites them to join the [FleetDM](https://github.com/fleetdm) GitHub organization. 
   When the new team member's work email is active, Mike McNeil will send invitations to join Fleet's Slack and to create Fleet-managed 1Password and Zoom accounts with their Fleet email. Mike McNeil sends the sign-in instructions to the new team member, accompanied by a brief explanation of the invitations sent.
6. **Before a new team member's first day:** Mike McNeil creates an onboarding issue in the [fleetdm/confidential](https://github.com/fleetdm/confidential/issues) GitHub repo for the new team member. Before creating the issue, Mike McNeil will go through it and comment on any steps that the new team member will not have to complete.


#### Purchasing a company-issued device
Fleet provides laptops for team members to use while working at Fleet. As soon as an offer is accepted, Nathan Holliday will reach out to the new team member to start this process, and will work with the new team member to get their laptop purchased and shipped to them on time.


##### Selecting a laptop
Most of the team at Fleet uses 16" MacBook Pros, but team members are free to choose any laptop or operating system that works for them, as long as the price [is within reason](#spending-company-money) and supported by our device management solution.  (Good news: Since Fleet uses Fleet for device management, every operating system is supported!)

When selecting a new laptop for a team member, optimize their configuration to:
1. have a reasonably large hard drive (at least 512GB hard drive, and if there's any concern go biger)
2. BUT make sure it's still available for delivery or pickup as quickly as possible, and prior to the start date

> Play around with build until it ships as quickly as possible.  Sometimes small changes lead to much faster ship times.  More standard configurations (with fewer customizations) usually ship more quickly.  Sometimes MacBook Pros ship more quickly than MacBook Airs, and vice versa.  This varies.  Remember: Always play around with the build and optimize for something that will **ship quickly**!

For example, someone in sales, marketing, or business operations might use a 14" Macbook Air, whereas someone in engineering, product, or a primarily design role might use a 16" MacBook Pro.

Windows and Linux devices are available upon request for team members in product and engineering.  (See [Buying other new equipment](#buying-other-new-equipment).)

##### Buying other new equipment
At Fleet, we [spend company money like it's our own money](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/business-operations#spending-company-money).  If you need equipment above and beyond those standard guidelines, you can request new equipment by creating a GitHub issue in fleetdm/fleet and attaching the `#g-business-operations`.  Please include a link to the requested equipment (including any specs), reason for request, and timeline for when the device is needed. 

##### Tracking equipment
When a device has been purchased, it's added to the [spreadsheet of company equipment](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hFlymLlRWIaWeVh14IRz03yE-ytBLfUaqVz0VVmmoGI/edit#gid=0) where we keep track of devices and equipment, purchased by Fleet.

When you receive your new their computer, complete the entry by adding a description, model, and serial number to the spreadsheet.



## Celebrations

### Weekly updates
We like to celebrate our achievements weekly in `#general`.
  - Every Thursday night, Mike McNeil creates a thread in #help-manage requesting weekly updates, and managers will reply to the thread with their weekly updates.
  - Friday afternoons, Mike McNeil updates the KPIs in the [weekly updates spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Hso0LxqwrRVINCyW_n436bNHmoqhoLhC8bcbvLPOs9A/edit#gid=0), and Friday nights, Mike McNeil will post the updates in #general.
Weekly update principles
   - Each department's update is 20-40 words or less.
   - Erring on the side of referring to items that are completely done and/or mentioning news that is potentially very exciting to folks throughout the company.
 
### Workiversaries
We're happy you've ventured a trip around the sun with Fleet. Let's celebrate!

- Each Friday, if there are any upcoming workiversaries in the next seven days, Mike McNeil posts about them in #g-people and tags @mikermcneil to let them know.
- Founders discuss during their 1:1, reviewing performance and the latest compensation benchmarks for this person's role and geography.
- If a compensation change is decided, Mike or Zach posts to Slack in `#g-people` with the change to compensation and effective date, if any.
- Mike McNeil makes sure that a copy of the compensation change is added to the [¶¶People Operations folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NKZ0UTmLbOPOeAA-iaEote3_diqu8Cbw?usp=share_link) for record keeping.
- Mike McNeil updates the respective payroll platform (Gusto or Pilot) and update the [Equity spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_GJlqnWWIQBiZFOoyl9YbTr72bg5qdSSp4O3kuKm1Jc/edit?usp=sharing) (internal doc).
- If additional follow-up is required for the compensation change, Mike McNeil works with the business operations team to take care of it.

### Equity grants
Equity grants for new hires are queued up as part of the [hiring process](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/business-operations#hiring), then grants and consents are [batched and processed quarterly](https://github.com/fleetdm/confidential/issues/new/choose).

Doing an equity grant involves:
1. executing a board consent
2. the recipient and CEO signing paperwork about the stock options
3. updating the number of shares for the recipient in the equity plan
4. updating Carta to reflect the grant

For the status of stock option grants, exercises, and all other _common stock_ including advisor, founder, and team member equity ownership, see [Fleet's equity plan](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_GJlqnWWIQBiZFOoyl9YbTr72bg5qdSSp4O3kuKm1Jc/edit#gid=0).  For information about investor ownership, see [Carta](https://app.carta.com/corporations/1234715/summary/).

> Fleet's [equity plan](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_GJlqnWWIQBiZFOoyl9YbTr72bg5qdSSp4O3kuKm1Jc/edit#gid=0) is the source of truth, not Carta.  Neither are pro formas sent in an email attachment, even if they come from lawyers.
> 
> Anyone can make mistakes, and none of us are perfect.  Even when we triple check.  Small mistakes in share counts can be hard to attribute, and can cause headaches and eat up nights of our CEO's and operations team's time.  If you notice what might be a discrepancy between the equity plan and any other secondary source of information, please speak up and let Fleet's CEO know ASAP.  Even if you're wrong, your note will be appreciated.

## Departures

### Communicating departures
Although it's sad to see you go, Fleet understands that not everything is meant to be forever like open-source is. There are a few steps that we'll need to take to communicate to the team of your departure. 
1. Direct team: The CEO will reach out to the departing teammember's direct reports in 1:1 calls.
2. Key stakeholders: The CEO will reach out to his direct reports about the departing teammember's departure.
3. Announcement: Mike McNeil will make an announcement during the "🌈 Weekly Update" post on Friday in the `#general` channel on Slack. 



## Onboarding a new advisor
Advisor agreements are sent through [DocuSign](https://www.docusign.com/), using the "Advisor Agreement"
template. To send a new advisor agreement, you'll need the new advisor's name and the number of shares they
are offered. 
Once you send the agreement, add a new row to the [advisory board spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15knBE2-PrQ1Ad-QcIk0mxCN-xFsATKK9hcifqrm0qFQ/edit#gid=1803674483) and enter the new advisor's information. Use this spreadsheet to track the advisor's progress through the onboarding process.
   >**_Note:_** *Be sure to mark any columns that haven't been completed yet as "TODO"*
When you complete the agreement, make sure it is in the correct Google Drive folder, update the [advisory board spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15knBE2-PrQ1Ad-QcIk0mxCN-xFsATKK9hcifqrm0qFQ/edit#gid=1803674483) to show that the agreement has been signed, and ask the new advisor to add us on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/71111416), [Crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/fleet-device-management), and [Angellist](https://angel.co/company/fleetdm).



## Security

At Fleet, we care about security. Here are a few resources about Fleet's security policies and best practices.
1. [Security policies](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/security/security-policies#security-policies)
2. [Human resources security policy](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/security/security-policies#human-resources-security-policy)

6. More details about internal security processes at Fleet are located on [the Security page](./security.md).


## Finance

### Monthly accounting
Create a [new montly accounting issue](https://github.com/fleetdm/confidential/issues/new/choose) for the current month and year named "Closing out YYYY-MM" in GitHub and complete all of the tasks in the issue. (This uses the [monthly accounting issue template](https://github.com/fleetdm/confidential/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/5-monthly-accounting.md).

#### When is the issue created?
In order to fulfill our monthly reporting requirement of providing GAAP financials which are not ready until after several days into the next month, we create the monthly accounting issue for the previous month on the third Friday of the following month.  For example, the monthly accounting issue to close out the month of January is created on the second Friday in February.  (This is because we won't necessarily have the GAAP financials from our accountants until as late as the 21st of the following month.)

#### SLA?
After it is created, the monthly accounting issue should be completed and closed within 3 business days.


### Payroll
Many of these processes are automated, but it's vital to check Gusto and Pilot manually for accuracy.
 - Salary employees are automated in Gusto and Pilot
 - Contractors are a manual process in Gusto and Pilot

| Unique payrolls              | Action                       | DRI                          |
|:-----------------------------|:-----------------------------|:-----------------------------|
| Commissions                  | "Off-cycle" payroll          | Nathan
| Sign-on bonus                | "Bonus" payroll              | Mike McNeil
| Performance bonus            | "Bonus" payroll              | Mike McNeil                     
| Ramp                         | "Off-cycle" payroll          | Nathan 
| Accelerations                | "Off-cycle" payroll          | Nathan

Add the amount to be paid to the "Gross" line.
For Fleet's US contractors, running payroll is a manual process. 
The steps for doing this are highlighted in this loom, TODO. 
1. Time tools
2. Time tracking
3. Review hours
4. Adjust time frame to match current payroll period (the 27th through 26th of the month)
5. Sync hours
6. Run contractor payroll

#### Commission payroll
- Update [commission calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vw6Q7kCC7-FdG5Fgx3ghgUdQiF2qwxk6njgK6z8_O9U/edit) with new revenue from any deals that are closed/won (have a subscription agreement signed by both parties) and have an **effective start date** within the previous month.
  - Find detailed notes on this process in [Notes - Run commission payroll in Gusto](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FQLpGxvHPW6X801HYYLPs5y8o943mmasQD3m9k_c0so/edit#). 
- Contact Mike McNeil in Slack and let her know he can run the commission payroll. Use the off-cycle payroll option in Gusto. Be sure to classify the payment as "Commission" in the "other earnings" field and not the generic  "Bonus."
- Once commission payroll has been run, update the [commission calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vw6Q7kCC7-FdG5Fgx3ghgUdQiF2qwxk6njgK6z8_O9U/edit) to mark the commission as paid. 

#### Updating a consultant's fee
 - Direct message Mike McNeil with hourly rate change information.
 - After CEO approval, Mike McNeil will issue a new contractor agreement with the updated fee via DocuSign.


### Annual reporting for capital credit line
- Within 60 days of the end of the year:
  - Provide Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) with our balance sheet and profit and loss statement (P&L, sometimes called a cashflow statement) for the past twelve months.  
  - Provide SVB with our annual operating budgets and projections (on a quarterly basis) for the coming year.
  - Deliver this as early as possible in case they have questions.

### Quarterly Quickbooks Online (QBO) check
- Check to make sure [bookkeeping quirks](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nuUPMZb1z_lrbaQEcgjnxppnYv_GWOTTo4FMqLOlsWg/edit?usp=sharing) are all accounted for and resolved or in progress toward resolution.
- Check balance sheet and profit and loss statements (P&Ls) in QBO against the [monthly workbooks](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ben-xJgL5MlMJhIl2OeQpDjbk-pF6eJM) in Google Drive.


## Taxes and compliance

From time to time, you may get notices in the mail from the IRS and/or state agencies regarding your company’s withholding and/or unemployment tax accounts. You can resolve many of these notices on your own by verifying and/or updating the settings in your Gusto account. 
If the notice is regarding an upcoming change to your deposit schedule or unemployment tax rate, Mike McNeil will make the change in Gusto. Including: 
 - Update your unemployment tax rate.
 - Update your federal deposit schedule.
 - Update your state deposit schedule.
**Important** Agencies do not send notices to Gusto directly, so it’s important that you read and take action before any listed deadlines or effective dates of requested changes.
Notices you should report to Gusto.
If you can't resolve the notice on your own, are unsure what the notice is in reference to, or the tax notice has a missing payment or balance owed, follow the steps in the Report and upload a tax notice in Gusto.
In Gusto, click **How to review your notice** to help you understand what kind of notice you received and what additional action you can take to help speed up the time it takes to resolve the issue.
For more information about how Fleet and our accounting team work together, check out [Fleet - who does what](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FFOudmHmfVFIk-hdIWoPFsvMPmsjnRB8/edit#gid=829046836) (private doc).

### State quarterly payroll and tax filings
Every quarter, payroll and tax filings are due for each state. Gusto can handle these automatically if Third-party authorization (TPA) is enabled. Each state is unique and Gusto has a library of [State registration and resources](https://support.gusto.com/hub/Employers-and-admins/Taxes-forms-and-compliance/State-registration-and-resources) available to review. 
You will need to grant Third-party authorization (TPA) per state and this should be checked quarterly before the filing due dates to ensure that Gusto can file on time. 

### CorpNet state registration process
In CorpNet, select "place an order for an existing business" we’ll need to have Foreign Registration and Payroll Tax Registration done.
  - You can have CorpNet do this by emailing the account rep "Subject: Fleet Device Management: State - Foreign Registration and Payroll Tax Registration" (this takes about two weeks).
  - You can do this between you and CorpNet by selecting "Foreign Qualification," placing the order and emailing the confirmation to the rep for Payroll registration (this is a short turnaround).
  - You can do this on your own by visiting the state's "Secretary of State" website and checking that the company name is available. To register online, you'll need the EIN, business address, information about the owners and their percentages, the first date of business, sales within the state, and the business type (usually get an email right away for approval ~24-48 hrs). 
For more information, check out [Fleet - who does what](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FFOudmHmfVFIk-hdIWoPFsvMPmsjnRB8/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=102440584423243016963&rtpof=true&sd=true).
