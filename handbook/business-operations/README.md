## Finance

#### Monthly accounting
Create a new issue for the current month and year named "Closing out YYYY-MM" using the [monthly accounting issue template](https://github.com/fleetdm/confidential/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/5-monthly-accounting.md) in GitHub and complete all of the tasks in the issue.  

#### Commission payroll
- Update [commission calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vw6Q7kCC7-FdG5Fgx3ghgUdQiF2qwxk6njgK6z8_O9U/edit) with new revenue from any deals that are closed/won (have a subscription agreement signed by both parties) and have an **effective start date** within the previous month.
  - Find detailed notes on this process in [Notes - Run commission payroll in Gusto](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FQLpGxvHPW6X801HYYLPs5y8o943mmasQD3m9k_c0so/edit#). 
- Contact Charlie Chance in Slack and let her know she can run the commission payroll. Use the off-cycle payroll option in Gusto. Be sure to classify the payment as "Commission" in the "other earnings" field and not the generic  "Bonus."
- Once commission payroll has been run, update the [commission calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vw6Q7kCC7-FdG5Fgx3ghgUdQiF2qwxk6njgK6z8_O9U/edit) to mark the commission as paid. 

#### Annual reporting for capital credit line
- Within 60 days of the end of the year:
  - Provide Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) with our balance sheet and profit and loss statement (P&L, sometimes called a cashflow statement) for the past twelve months.  
  - Provide SVB with our annual operating budgets and projections (on a quarterly basis) for the coming year.
  - Deliver this as early as possible in case they have questions.

#### Quarterly Quickbooks Online (QBO) check
- Check to make sure [bookkeeping quirks](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nuUPMZb1z_lrbaQEcgjnxppnYv_GWOTTo4FMqLOlsWg/edit?usp=sharing) are all accounted for and resolved or in progress toward resolution.
- Check balance sheet and profit and loss statements (P&Ls) in QBO against the [monthly workbooks](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ben-xJgL5MlMJhIl2OeQpDjbk-pF6eJM) in Google Drive.

#### Spending company money
As we continue to expand our company policies, we use [GitLab's open expense policy](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/spending-company-money/) as a guide for company spending.
In brief, this means that as a Fleet team member, you may:
* Spend company money like it is your own money.
* Be responsible for what you need to purchase or expense to do your job effectively.
* Feel free to make purchases __in the company's interest__ without asking for permission beforehand (when in doubt, do __inform__ your manager prior to purchase or as soon as possible after the purchase).
For more developed thoughts about __spending guidelines and limits__, please read [GitLab's open expense policy](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/spending-company-money/).

#### Attending conferences or company travel
When attending a conference or traveling for Fleet, please make a post in [#help-brex](https://fleetdm.slack.com/archives/C0396TYH4EP) on Slack with the following information:
- The start and end dates for your trip.
- The price of your flight (feel free to optimize a direct flight if there is one that is less than double the price of the cheapest non-direct flight).
- The price of your hotel per night (dry cleaning is allowable if the stay is over 3 days).
- The price of the admission fees if attending a conference.
- $100 allowance per day for food and beverage **(movies, and mini bars are not allowed)**.
- Customer/Partner Facing Events:
  - Gala/Black Tie Events: Tuxedo or Gown Rental, $150-$225 USD per event is reimbursable. **(The event must be customer specific and the invitation must state black tie only)**.
The monthly limit on your Brex card will be increased temporarily as necessary to accommodate the increased spending associated with the conference.
We highly recommend you order a physical Brex card if you do not have one before attending the conference.

#### Non-travel purchases that exceed a Brex cardholder's limit
For non-travel purchases that would require an increase in the Brex cardholder's limit, please make a post in [#g-business-opeartions](https://fleetdm.slack.com/archives/C047N5L6EGH)) on Slack with the following information:
- The nature of the purchase (i.e. SaaS subscription and what it's used for)
- The cost of the purchase and whether it is a fixed or variable (i.e. use-based) cost.
- Whether it is a one time purchase or a recurring purchase and at what frequency the purchase will re-occur (annually, monthly, etc.)
- If there are more ideal options to pay for the purchase (i.e. bill.com, the Fleet AP Brex card, etc.) that method will be used instead.  
- In general, recurring purchases such as subscription services that will continually stretch the spend limit on a cardholder's Brex card should be paid through other means. 
- For one time purchases where payment via credit card is the most convenient then the card limit will be temporarily increased to accomodate the purchase.  


## BizOps

#### Zoom
We use [Zoom](https://zoom.us) for virtual meetings at Fleet, and it is important that every team member feels comfortable hosting, joining, and scheduling Zoom meetings.
By default, Zoom settings are the same for all Fleet team members, but you can change your personal settings on your [profile settings](https://zoom.us/profile/setting) page. 
Settings that have a lock icon next to them have been locked by an administrator and cannot be changed. Zoom administrators can change settings for all team members on the [account settings page](https://zoom.us/account/setting) or for individual accounts on the [user management page](https://zoom.us/account/user#/).

#### Gong
Capturing video from meetings with customers, prospects, and community members outside the company is an important part of building world-class sales and customer success teams and is a widespread practice across the industry.
At Fleet, we use Gong to capture Zoom meetings and share them company-wide if a team member with a Gong license attends certain meetings, generally those with at least one person from outside of Fleet in attendance.  
While some other Fleeties may have a Gong seat if it becomes necessary in their work, the typical use case at Fleet is for employees on the company's sales, customer success, or customer support teams. You should be notified anytime you join a recorded call with an audio message announcing "this meeting is being recorded" or "recording in progress."  To stop a recording, the host of the call can press "Stop." If the call has external participants and is recorded, this call is stored in Gong for future use. In order to use Gong, the Zoom call must be hosted by someone with a Fleet email address.  You cannot use Gong to record calls hosted by external parties.
To access a recording saved in Gong, visit [app.gong.io](app.gong.io) and sign in with SSO. Everyone at Fleet has access, whether they have a Gong seat or not, and you can explore and search through any uploaded call transcripts unless someone marks them as private (though the best practice would be not to record any calls you don't want to be captured). If you ever make a mistake and need to delete something, you can delete the video in Gong or reach out to Nathan Holliday or Mike McNeil for help. They will delete it immediately without watching the video. Note that any recording stopped within 60 seconds of the start of the recording is not saved in Gong, and there will be no saved record of it. Cloud recording in Zoom has to be turned on and unlocked company wide for Gong to function properly, because of this, there is a chance that some Gong recordings may still save in Zoom's cloud storage even if they aren't uploaded into Gong. To counter this, Nathan Holliday will periodically delete all recordings found in Zoom's storage without viewing them.
Most folks at Fleet should see no difference in their meetings if they aren't interfacing with external parties. For those with a Gong seat or scheduling a call with someone in attendance that has a Gong seat who does not wish for their Zoom call with an external party to record, words and phrases in the Zoom call title will disable the Gong recording for the call. 1 on 1, 1:1, confidential, interview, internal and no shadows are some commonly used words that will disable Gong. A complete list can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OOxLajvqf-on5I8viN7k6aCzqEWS2B24_mE47OefutE/edit?usp=sharing).  If you need words added to the list of exlusionary words, please reach out to Nathan Holliday.
We have excluded anyone with an email domain from @cooley.com or @formationfinancial.com from Gong's recording feature. These are professional services firms working with Fleet on internal matters, and calls with them are considered internal.  
Our goal in using Gong and recording calls is to capture insights from sales, customer, and community meetings and improve how we position and sell our product. We never intend to make anyone uncomfortable, and we hope you reach out to our DRI for Gong, Nathan Holliday, or Mike McNeil if you have questions or concerns.  
If you need help using Gong, please check out Gong Acaedmy at [https://academy.gong.io/](https://academy.gong.io/).

#### Slack
At Fleet, we do not send internal emails to each other. Instead, we prefer to use Slack to communicate with other folks who work at Fleet.
We use threads in Slack as much as possible. Threads help limit noise for other people following the channel and reduce notification overload.
We configure our [working hours in Slack](https://slack.com/help/articles/360025054173-Set-up-Slack-for-work-hours-) to make sure everyone knows when they can get in touch with others.

#### Zapier and DocuSign
We use Zapier to automate how completed DocuSign envelopes are formatted and stored. This process ensures we store signed documents in the correct folder and that filenames are formatted consistently. 
When the final signature is added to an envelope in DocuSign, it is marked as completed and sent to Zapier, where it goes through these steps:
1. Zapier sends the following information about the DocuSign envelope to our Hydroplane webhook:
   - **`emailSubject`** - The subject of the envelope sent by DocuSign. Our DocuSign templates are configured to format the email subject as `[type of document] for [signer's name]`.
   - **`emailCsv`** - A comma-separated list of signers' email addresses.
2. The Hydroplane webhook matches the document type to the correct Google Drive folder, orders the list of signers, creates a timestamp, and sends that data back to Zapier as
   - **`destinationFolderID`** - The slug for the Google Drive folder where we store this type of document.
   - **`emailCsv`** - A sorted list of signers' email addresses.
   - **`date`** - The date the document was completed in DocuSign, formatted YYYY-MM-DD.
3. Zapier uses this information to upload the file to the matched Google Drive folder, with the filename formatted as `[date] - [emailSubject] - [emailCvs].PDF`.
4. Once the file is uploaded, Zapier uses the Slack integration to post in the #peepops channel with the message:
   ```
   Now complete with all signatures:
      [email subject]
      link: drive.google.com/[destinationFolderID]
   ```

#### Salesforce 
We consider Salesforce to be our Rolodex for customer information. During the onboarding process, you may need to add a license for the new hire. Here are the steps we take: 
1. Go to “Your account.”
2. View contracts -> pick current contract.
3. Add the number of licenses.
4. Sign DocuSign sent to the email.
5. The order will be processed in ~30m.

### CEO handbook
[The CEO handbook](./ceo-handbook.md) details processes specific to Mike McNeil, CEO of Fleet. 


### Directly responsible individuals
At Fleet, we use the concept of Directly Responsible Individuals (**DRI**s). This person is singularly responsible for a given aspect of the open source project, the product, or the company.
This person is accountable for accomplishing goals and making decisions about a particular element of Fleet.
DRIs help us collaborate efficiently by knowing exactly who is responsible and can make decisions about the work they're doing and are available to view in the [codeowners file](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/blob/main/CODEOWNERS).
>You can read more about directly responsible individuals in [GitLab's handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/directly-responsible-individuals/)


### Benefits

#### Coworking
Fleet will reimburse team members for coworking up to $100 USD per month. Please get prior approval from your manager, and then this reimbursement can be used for drop-in coworking or go towards a coworking membership.  Once approved, get started by reaching out to the Charlie Chance via direct message in Slack.
Coworking expenses must be [reimbursed](#reimbursements). Brex cards should not be used for coworking due to possible legal complexities.

#### Paid time off
What matters most is your results, which are driven by your focus, your availability to collaborate, and the time and consideration you put into your work. Fleet offers all team members unlimited time off. Whether you're sick, you want to take a trip, you are eager for some time to relax, or you need to get some chores done around the house, any reason is a good reason.
For team members working in jurisdictions that require certain mandatory sick leave or PTO policies, Fleet complies to the extent required by law.

#### Taking time off
When you take any time off, you should follow this process:
- Let your manager and team know as soon as possible (i.e., post a message in your team's Slack channel with when and how long).
- Find someone to cover anything that needs covering while you're out and communicate what they need to take over the responsibilities as well as who to refer to for help (e.g., meetings, planned tasks, unfinished business, important Slack/email threads, anything where someone might be depending on you).
- Mark an all-day "Out of office" event in Google Calendar for the day(s) you're taking off.
If you can’t complete the above because you need to take the day off quickly due to an emergency, let your manager know and they will help you complete the handoff.
If you ever want to take a day off, and the only thing stopping you is internal (Fleetie-only) meetings, don’t stress. Consider, “Is this a meeting that I can reschedule to another day, or is this a meeting that can go on without me and not interfere with the company’s plans?” Talk to your manager if you’re unsure, but it is perfectly OK to reschedule internal meetings that can wait so that you can take a day off.
This process is the same for any days you take off, whether it's a holiday or you just need a break.
   
#### Holidays
At Fleet, we have team members with various employment classifications in many different countries worldwide. Fleet is a US company, but we think you should choose the days you want to work and what days you are on holiday, rather than being locked into any particular nation or culture's expectation about when to take time off.
When a team member joins Fleet, they pick one of the following holiday schedules:
 - **Traditional**: This is based on the country where you work. Non-US team members should let their managers know the dates of national holidays.
 **Or**
 - **Freestyle**: You have no set schedule and start with no holidays. Then you add the days that are holidays to you.
Either way, it's up to you to make sure that your responsibilities are covered, and that your team knows you're out of the office.

#### New parent leave
Fleet gives new parents six weeks of paid leave. After six weeks, if you don't feel ready to return yet, we'll set up a quick call to discuss and work together to come up with a plan to help you return to work gradually or when you're ready.

#### Compensation changes
Fleet evaluates compensation during annual workiversaries. Supervisors and managers will document compensation changes and effective date in employee 1:1 docs and email confirmation to Charlie. Charlie will make sure that a copy of the compensation change is added to the [¶¶People Operations folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NKZ0UTmLbOPOeAA-iaEote3_diqu8Cbw?usp=share_link) for record keeping. (For the forseeable (pre series B) future, comp changes will originate during zach/mike 1:1s in our agenda doc.)
Additional steps: Charlie will update the respective payroll platform (Gusto or Pilot) and update the [Equity spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_GJlqnWWIQBiZFOoyl9YbTr72bg5qdSSp4O3kuKm1Jc/edit?usp=sharing) (internal doc).


### Payroll
Many of these processes are automated, but it's vital to check Gusto and Pilot manually for accuracy.
 - Salary employees are automated in Gusto and Pilot
 - Contractors are a manual process in Gusto and Pilot

| Unique payrolls              | Action                       | DRI                          |
|:-----------------------------|:-----------------------------|:-----------------------------|
| Commissions                  | "Off-cycle" payroll          | Nathan
| Sign-on bonus                | "Bonus" payroll              | Charlie
| Performance bonus            | "Bonus" payroll              | Charlie                     
| Ramp                         | "Off-cycle" payroll          | Nathan 
| Accelerations                | "Off-cycle" payroll          | Nathan

Add the amount to be paid to the "Gross" line.
For Fleet's US contractors, running payroll is a manual process. 
The steps for doing this are highlighted in this loom, TODO. 
1. Time tools
2. Time tracking
3. Review hours
4. Adjust time frame to match current payroll period (the 27th through 26th of the month)
5. Sync hours
6. Run contractor payroll

#### Reimbursements
We provide all of our team members with Brex cards for making purchases for the company. Fleet will reimburse team members who pay for work-related expenses with their personal funds.
Team members can request reimbursement through [Gusto]([https://app.gusto.com/expenses](https://support.gusto.com/article/209831449100000/Get-reimbursed-for-expenses-as-an-employee)) if they're in the US or [Pilot]([https://pilot.co/](https://help.pilot.co/en/articles/4658204-how-to-request-a-reimbursement#:~:text=If%20you%20made%20a%20purchase,and%20click%20'Add%20new%20expense.)) if they are an international team member. When submitting an expense report, team members need to provide the receipt and a description of the expense.
Operations will review the expense and reach out to the team member if they have any questions. The reimbursement will be added to the team member's next payroll when an expense is approved.
>Pilot handles reimbursements differently depending on if the international team member is classified as an employee or a contractor. If the reimbursement is for a contractor, Operations will need to add the expense reimbursement to an upcoming recurring payment or schedule the reimbursement as an off-cycle payment. If the reimbursement is for an employee, no other action is needed; Pilot will add the reimbursement to the team member's next payroll. 


#### Performance feedback
At Fleet, performance feedback is a continuous process. We give feedback (particularly negative) as soon as possible. Most feedback will happen during 1:1 meetings, if not sooner.
Founders evaluate and update compensation decisions yearly, shortly after the anniversary of a team member's start date.


### Security
At Fleet, we care about security. Here are a few resources about Fleet's security policies and best practices.
1. [Security Policies](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/security/security-policies#security-policies)
2. [Human Resources Security Policy](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/security/security-policies#human-resources-security-policy)
3. [Account recovery process](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/security#account-recovery-process)
4. [Personal mobile devices](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/security#personal-mobile-devices)
5. [Hardware security keys](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/security#hardware-security-keys)


### All the things

#### Key reviews
Every release cycle, each department leader prepares a [key review deck](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/key-review/#purpose) and presents it to the CEO. In this deck, the department will highlight KPI metrics and progress of OKRs. The information for creating this deck is located in the ["🌈 Fleet" Google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lizTSi7YotG_zA7zJeHuOXTg_KF1Ji8k) using ["How to create key review"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PDwJL0HiCz-KbEGZMfldAYX_aLk5OVAU1MMSgMYYF2A/edit?usp=sharing)(internal doc).

#### Meetings
* At Fleet, meetings start whether you're there or not. Nevertheless, being even a few minutes late can make a big difference and slow your meeting counterparts down. When in doubt, show up a couple of minutes early.
* It's okay to spend the first minute or two of a meeting being present and making small talk. Since we are all remote, it's easy to miss out on hallway chatter and human connections that happen in [meatspace](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/meatspace).  Use this time together during the first minute to say "Hi!"  Then you can jump into the topics to be discussed.
* Turning on your camera allows for more complete and intuitive verbal and non-verbal communication. Feel free to leave your camera on or turn it off when joining meetings with new participants you might not be familiar with yet. Turn your camera on when you lead or cohost a meeting.
* In an all-remote company, “face time” matters. Remember: even if someone’s calendar is open, they have other work to do. Limiting (or batching up) internal meetings can enable longer, uninterrupted stretches of deep work.

#### Internal meeting scheduling
Use the Google Calendar "[Find a meeting
time](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37161?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop#zippy=%2Cfind-a-meeting-time)"
feature to coordinate meetings with Fleet team members. Enter the `@fleetdm.com` emails for each
participant into the "Meet with..." box in Google Calendar, and the calendar availability for each
participant will appear in your view. Then, when you select a meeting time, those participants will
automatically be invited, and a video conference will be attached to the invite.
Please prefer this strategy over negotiating meeting times via chat -- This can save a lot of
communication overhead, especially when scheduling with multiple participants.
It is important to [set your working
hours](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/7638168?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop) in
Google Calendar and block out any personal time/events/PTO, so that team members do not inadvertently
schedule a time when you are not available. Many team members use the free tier of
[reclaim.ai](https://reclaim.ai/) to synchronize personal event times (without event details) into
their work calendars. It is also common practice to block out time for focused work.

#### Modifying an event organized by someone else
To edit an event where someone else at Fleet is the organizer, you can first subscribe to their calendar in Google Calendar and then edit the event on their calendar.  Your edits will automatically apply to all attendees.
> This works because every Fleetie grants edit access to everyone else at Fleet as part of onboarding.

#### External meeting scheduling
When scheduling external meetings, provide external participants with a
[Calendly](https://calendly.com) link to schedule with the relevant internal participants. If you
need a Calendly account, reach out to `@charlottechance` via Slack.

#### Scheduling a Zoom meeting
We use the Zoom add-on for Google Calendar to schedule Zoom meetings when we create calendar events. To add a Zoom meeting to a calendar event, click the "Add video conferencing" dropdown and select "Zoom Meeting." Google Calendar will automatically add the Zoom meeting details and instructions to join the event.
We configure our Zoom meetings to let participants join before the host starts the meeting. We do this to make sure meetings start on time, even if the host isn't there.

#### Slack channel prefixes
We have specific channels for various topics, but we also have more general channels for the teams at Fleet.
We use these prefixes to organize the Fleet Slack:
 * ***g-***: for team/group channels *(Note: "g-" is short for "grupo")*.
 * ***oooh-***: used to discuss and share interesting information about a topic.
 * ***help-***: for asking for help on specific topics.
 * ***at*** or ***fleet-at***: for customer channels.

#### Slack communications and best practices
In consideration of our team, Fleet avoids using global tags in channels (i.e. @here, @channel, etc). 
      1. What about polls? Good question, Fleeties are asked to post their poll in the channel and @mention the teammates they would like to hear from. 
      2. Why does this matter? Great question! The Fleet [culture](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company#culture) is pretty simple: think of others, and remember the company [Values](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company#values).


### Hiring

#### Creating a new position
Every new position being created goes through this process before interviewing, accepting applicants, or extending offers.
1. Add the proposed position to ["Fleeties"](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OSLn-ZCbGSjPusHPiR5dwQhheH1K8-xqyZdsOe9y7qc/edit#gid=0) as a new row, with a blank start date.  Be sure to include job title, manager, and department.
2. Add a job description to the ["Roles."](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wS5jFfrZtO4xMH-3U_S8pE59gNXOTR3rS1WWD8pkq9E/edit#heading=h.5z24knw25190)  Include only "Responsibilities" and "Experience." (You will insert these into the existing job description template.)
3. Create a private "#hiring-xxxxxx-2022" Slack channel (where "xxxxxx" is the job title) and invite the CEO (Mike McNeil) and People Operations (Charlie Chance).
  - People Ops is the DRI for all `#hiring-xxxxx-2022` Slack channels.
4. In that channel, post a message proposing the position:
  - At-mention CEO (@mikermcneil) and Charlie (@charlie).
  - Include a link to the job description in "Roles."
  - Include a link to the Fleeties document.
5. People Ops will:
  - Confirm the "Roles" document has the job description, consisting only of "Responsibilities" and "Experience," and that both look accurate, grammatically correct, and otherwise ready to post in a public job description.
  - Confirm the "Fleeties" document has a manager, job title, and department, and that the start date is not entered yet (so we can tell the position is proposed but not planned, yet).
  - Using Pave, determine an anticipated salary and equity range, then add that research to "Compensation decisions" as a new heading.
  - Share a direct link to the new heading in "Compensation decisions" with the CEO.
6. The CEO will then:
  - Determine whether this fits into the budget and equity plan.
  - Decide whether Fleet will open this position at this time.
  - Set tentative compensation in the budget and equity plan.
  - Set a tentative start date in the Fleeties doc to indicate this position is now part of the hiring plan.
  - Reply in the `#hiring-xxxxx-2022` Slack channel, at-mentioning the original proposer, to let them know the new position is approved.
After getting CEO approval, create a position in Breezy.

#### Creating a new position in Breezy
> TODO: document how to post a job on fleetdm.com/apply using Breezy and manage the hiring process

#### Interviewing at Fleet
We're glad you're interested in joining the team! 
Here are some of the things you can anticipate throughout this process:
  - We try to reply by email within one business day from the time when the application arrives.
  - You may receive a rejection email (Bummer, consider applying again in the future).
  - You may receive an invitation to "book with us."
If you've been invited to "book with us," you'll have a Zoom meeting with the hiring team to discuss the next steps. 

#### Hiring a new team member
> Fleet is unable to hire team members in some countries. See [this internal document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jHHJqShIyvlVwzx1C-FB9GC74Di_Rfdgmhpai1SPC0g/edit) for the list.
1. **Manager:** At-mention People Operations in the `#hiring-xxxxx-2022` channel and indicate that you would like for Fleet to make an offer to the candidate.  Include the candidate's name, personal email address, the timeframe for their start date, and the country where they will be working. 
2. **People Ops:** People Operations will research compensation using [Pave](https://www.pave.com), making sure to adjust for the cost of living where the candidate will do the work.  _If People Ops is unsure of their findings, ask for help from the CEO._  People Ops will then document this decision in the [compensation decisions document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NQ-IjcOTbyFluCWqsFLMfP4SvnopoXDcX0civ-STS5c/edit) for future reference.
3. **People Ops:** After you have determined compensation, make copies of these two templates and customize them for this candidate:
   - [Exit scenarios (template)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1k2TzsFYR0QxlD-KGPxuhuvvlJMrCvLPo2z8s8oGChT0/copy)
   - [Informal offer email (template)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zpNN2LWzAj-dVBC8iOg9jLurNlSe7XWKU69j7ntWtbY/copy)
Change the name of the copied documents accordingly (e.g., "[candidate's name]'s a copy of exit scenarios") and link to the exit scenarios spreadsheet from the offer email.
4. **People Ops:** Next, prepare the informal offer email. Post in the `#g-people` Slack channel and at-mention the CEO for assistance with determining the number of shares.  You'll then need to add the following information to the template: 
   - Candidate's name and email address
   - Candidate's start date
   - Candidate's compensation
   - Candidate's manager (the person they report to)
   - Equity offered to the candidate (specify the number of shares, and highlight it with a link to the candidate's exit scenarios spreadsheet)
   - Benefits (determined by the candidate's location)
5. **People Ops:** Prepare the exit scenarios spreadsheet. Enter the number of shares offered to the candidate, and the spreadsheet will update to reflect this. 
      >**_Note:_** *Don't play with numbers in the exit scenarios spreadsheet. The revision history is visible to the candidate, and they might misunderstand.*
6. **People Ops:** Once both documents are complete, share the offer email draft, exit scenarios copy, and a link to the compensation decision with the CEO for approval by mentioning @mikermcneil in #g-people.
7. **CEO:** Confirm:
  - The compensation decision has been documented sufficiently and adjusted for the cost of living.
  - The equity plan and budget are up to date with the actual offer that is about to be sent.
  - The Fleeties doc now reflects the actual start date from the offer email, as well as the candidate's name, LinkedIn URL, and preferred pronoun.
  - It still makes business sense to make this offer by reviewing the budget and equity plan.
The CEO will then reply in `#g-people` to indicate that the offer is approved.
   >**_Note:_** *When hiring an international employee, Pilot.co recommends starting the hiring process a month before the new employee's start date.*
8. **People Ops:** After obtaining CEO approval, confirm everything is correct one more time, then mention the CEO or CTO, who will send the offer email.
  - The offer email is copied directly from Google Drive into Gmail before being sent to the candidate.
  - When sending the offer, the CEO or CTO will edit the permissions of the exit scenarios sheet so it is accessible to the candidate.
  - People Ops is cc'd on the offer email but will not participate in the email thread until after the offer is accepted.

#### Hiring a new consultant
Consultant agreements are sent through [DocuSign](https://www.docusign.com/), using the "Consulting Agreement" template. To send a new consulting agreement, you'll need the new consultant's name, the term of the service, a summary of the services provided, and the consultant's fee. 
There are some defaults that we use for these agreements:
   - Term: one month
   - Services rendered: [use this doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b5SGgYEHqDmq5QF8p29WWN3it3XJh3xRT3zG0RdXARo/edit)
   - Work will commence and complete by dates: Start date and end of term date
   - Fee: Get from the contractor
   - Hours: Default to 10 hr/week - 40 hr/week
Then hit send!  After all of the signatures are there, the completed document will automatically be uploaded to the appropriate Google Drive folder, and a Slack message will appear in the `#g-people` channel.

#### Updating a consultant's fee
 - Direct message Charlie with rate change information.
 - Charlie will post the information to `#g-people` and tag the CEO for approval.
 - After CEO approval, Charlie will issue a new contractor agreement with the updated fee via DocuSign.


### Onboarding

#### Steps after an offer is accepted
1. Once an applicant accepts an offer in writing, People Ops replies to the candidate.
2. People Ops creates a [hiring issue](https://github.com/fleetdm/confidential/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/hiring.md) for the new team member in the [fleetdm/confidential](https://github.com/fleetdm/confidential/issues) repo. People Ops will use this issue to keep track of the hiring tasks for the new team member.
3. People Ops reaches out to the new team member via email to get any information they will need to prepare an agreement and add them to our payroll system.
   - **US team members**: People Ops will send the new team member's agreement through [DocuSign](https://www.docusign.com/).
  After signing and storing an in the correct Google Drive folder, People Ops will invite the new team member to onboard in [Gusto](https://www.gusto.com/). People Ops will reach out to them if the new team member is a W-2 employee and schedule an I-9 verification meeting.
   >*If we're hiring in a new state, we'll have to register for state taxes and unemployment. Gusto usually handles this process.*
   - **For international team members:** People Ops enters the new team member's information into [Pilot](https://pilot.co/) to kick off their hiring process. Pilot creates an agreement for the new team member, and People Ops reviews it to make sure everything looks correct. After People Ops confirms the information about the new hire, Pilot invites the new team member to enter the rest of their information and informs People Ops via email when a new Fleetie signs their agreement.
4. **As soon as we have a signed agreement with a new team member:** People Ops reaches out to the new team member to provide them with a [work device](#purchasing-a-company-issued-device) and a pair of [YubiKeys](./../security.md#hardware-security-keys). People Ops then requests a screenshot or link to the new Fleetie's preferred device and configuration. People Ops orders their device and Yubikeys using his Brex card and has them shipped directly to the new team member.
   >*If the new team member is in the US and requests a MacBook, It will be purchased using our Apple business account. For MacBooks purchased with this account, Apple will ship pre-configured and enrolled in our MDM.*
5. **Two weeks before their first day at Fleet:** People Ops creates a [Google Workspace account](https://admin.google.com/ac/users) for the new team member and invites them to join the [FleetDM](https://github.com/fleetdm) GitHub organization. 
   When the new team member's work email is active, People Ops will send invitations to join Fleet's Slack and to create Fleet-managed 1Password and Zoom accounts with their Fleet email. People Ops sends the sign-in instructions to the new team member, accompanied by a brief explanation of the invitations sent.
6. **Before a new team member's first day:** People Ops creates an onboarding issue in the [fleetdm/confidential](https://github.com/fleetdm/confidential/issues) GitHub repo for the new team member. Before creating the issue, People Ops will go through it and comment on any steps that the new team member will not have to complete.

#### Team member onboarding
It's important that every team member at Fleet takes the time to get fully trained and onboarded. 
When a new team member joins Fleet, we create an onboarding issue for them in the [fleetdm/confidential](https://github.com/fleetdm/confidential) repo using this [issue template](https://github.com/fleetdm/confidential/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/onboarding.md). 
We want to make sure that the new team member will be able to complete every task in their issue. To make sure the new team member is successful in their onboarding, we customize their issue by commenting on any tasks they won't need to complete.
We believe in taking onboarding and training seriously and that the onboarding template is an essential source of truth and good use of time for every single new hire. If managers see a step that they don't feel is necessary, they should make a pull request to the [onboarding template](https://github.com/fleetdm/confidential/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/onboarding.md) and request a review from People operations.

#### Sightseeing tour
During their onboarding at Fleet, new team members are asked to schedule a sightseeing tour call with People operations. During this call, the new team member will participate in an interactive tour that includes:
- GitHub issues: the living bloodstream of the company.
- Kanban boards: the bulletin board of quests you can get and how you update status and let folks know things are done.
- Google Calendar: the future.
- Gmail: like any mailbox, full of junk mail, plus some important things, so it is important to check carefully.
- Salesforce: the Rolodex.
- Google Docs: the archives.
- Slack:
  - The "office" (#g-, #general).
  - The walkie talkies (DMs).
  - The watering hole (#oooh-, #random, #news, #help-).

#### Contributor experience training
During their first week at Fleet, new team members are asked to schedule a contributor experience training call with People operations. During this call, the new team member will share their screen, and People operations will:
- make sure emails will get seen and responded to quickly.
- make sure Slack messages will get seen and responded to quickly.
- make sure you know where your issues are tracked, which kanban board you use, and what the columns mean.
- make sure you can succeed with submitting a PR with the GitHub web editor, modifying docs or handbook, and working with Markdown.
- talk about Google calendar.
- give you a quick tour of the Fleet Google drive folder.

#### Onboarding a new advisor
Advisor agreements are sent through [DocuSign](https://www.docusign.com/), using the "Advisor Agreement"
template. To send a new advisor agreement, you'll need the new advisor's name and the number of shares they
are offered. 
Once you send the agreement, add a new row to the [advisory board spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15knBE2-PrQ1Ad-QcIk0mxCN-xFsATKK9hcifqrm0qFQ/edit#gid=1803674483) and enter the new advisor's information. Use this spreadsheet to track the advisor's progress through the onboarding process.
   >**_Note:_** *Be sure to mark any columns that haven't been completed yet as "TODO"*
When you complete the agreement, make sure it is in the correct Google Drive folder, update the [advisory board spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15knBE2-PrQ1Ad-QcIk0mxCN-xFsATKK9hcifqrm0qFQ/edit#gid=1803674483) to show that the agreement has been signed, and ask the new advisor to add us on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/71111416), [Crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/fleet-device-management), and [Angellist](https://angel.co/company/fleetdm).

#### Purchasing a company-issued device
Fleet provides laptops for team members to use while working at Fleet. As soon as an offer is accepted, `@charlottechance` will reach out to the new team member to start this process. `@charlottechance` will work with the new team member to get their laptop purchased and shipped to them.
Most of the team at Fleet uses 16" MacBook Pros, but team members are free to choose any laptop or operating system that works for them, as long as the price [is within reason](#spending-company-money).
When selecting your new laptop, we ask that you optimize your configuration to have a large hard drive and be available for delivery or pickup quickly, without waiting for customization.
New equipment for projects are requested in #help-business-operations, please tag `@charlottechance` in your post. Include device requested (specs), reason for request, and timeline for when the device is needed. 
When a device has been purchased, it's added to the [spreadsheet of company equipment](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hFlymLlRWIaWeVh14IRz03yE-ytBLfUaqVz0VVmmoGI/edit#gid=0) where we keep track of devices and equipment, purchased by Fleet. When the team member receives their computer, they will complete the entry by adding a description, model, and serial number to the spreadsheet.


### Taxes and compliance

From time to time, you may get notices in the mail from the IRS and/or state agencies regarding your company’s withholding and/or unemployment tax accounts. You can resolve many of these notices on your own by verifying and/or updating the settings in your Gusto account. 
If the notice is regarding an upcoming change to your deposit schedule or unemployment tax rate, Charlie will make the change in Gusto. Including: 
 - Update your unemployment tax rate.
 - Update your federal deposit schedule.
 - Update your state deposit schedule.
**Important** Agencies do not send notices to Gusto directly, so it’s important that you read and take action before any listed deadlines or effective dates of requested changes.
Notices you should report to Gusto.
If you can't resolve the notice on your own, are unsure what the notice is in reference to, or the tax notice has a missing payment or balance owed, follow the steps in the Report and upload a tax notice in Gusto.
In Gusto, click **How to review your notice** to help you understand what kind of notice you received and what additional action you can take to help speed up the time it takes to resolve the issue.
For more information about how Fleet and our accounting team work together, check out [Fleet - who does what](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FFOudmHmfVFIk-hdIWoPFsvMPmsjnRB8/edit#gid=829046836) (private doc).

#### State quarterly payroll and tax filings
Every quarter, payroll and tax filings are due for each state. Gusto can handle these automatically if Third-party authorization (TPA) is enabled. Each state is unique and Gusto has a library of [State registration and resources](https://support.gusto.com/hub/Employers-and-admins/Taxes-forms-and-compliance/State-registration-and-resources) available to review. 
You will need to grant Third-party authorization (TPA) per state and this should be checked quarterly before the filing due dates to ensure that Gusto can file on time. 

#### CorpNet state registration process
   In CorpNet, select "place an order for an existing business" we’ll need to have Foreign Registration and Payroll Tax Registration done.
   - You can have CorpNet do this by emailing the account rep "Subject: Fleet Device Management: State - Foreign Registration and Payroll Tax Registration" (this takes about two weeks).
   - You can do this between you and CorpNet by selecting "Foreign Qualification," placing the order and emailing the confirmation to the rep for Payroll registration (this is a short turnaround).
   - You can do this on your own by visiting the state's "Secretary of State" website and checking that the company name is available. To register online, you'll need the EIN, business address, information about the owners and their percentages, the first date of business, sales within the state, and the business type (usually get an email right away for approval ~24-48 hrs). 
For more information, check out [Fleet - who does what](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FFOudmHmfVFIk-hdIWoPFsvMPmsjnRB8/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=102440584423243016963&rtpof=true&sd=true).

#### Recruiting progress checkup
Weekly, Charlie looks in the [Fleeties spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OSLn-ZCbGSjPusHPiR5dwQhheH1K8-xqyZdsOe9y7qc/edit#gid=0) and reports on each open position:
 - Is the position in [BreezyHR](https://app.breezy.hr/signin)?
 - Is the position listed on fleetdm.com/jobs?
 - What is the total # applicants?
 - Total # interviews? 


### Celebrations

#### Weekly updates
We like to celebrate our achievements weekly in `#general`.
  - Every Thursday night, Charlie creates a thread in #help-manage requesting weekly updates, and managers will reply to the thread with their weekly updates.
  - Friday afternoons, Charlie updates the KPIs in the [weekly updates spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Hso0LxqwrRVINCyW_n436bNHmoqhoLhC8bcbvLPOs9A/edit#gid=0), and Friday nights, Charlie will post the updates in #general.
Weekly update principles
   - Each department's update is 20-40 words or less.
   - Erring on the side of referring to items that are completely done and/or mentioning news that is potentially very exciting to folks throughout the company.
 
#### Workiversaries
We're happy you've ventured a trip around the sun with Fleet. Let's celebrate!
- Each Friday, if there are any upcoming workiversaries in the next seven days, People Operations posts about them in #g-people and tags @mikermcneil to let them know.


### Departures

#### Communicating departures
Although it's sad to see you go, Fleet understands that not everything is meant to be forever like open-source is. There are a few steps that we'll need to take to communicate to the team of your departure. 
1. Direct team: The CEO will reach out to the departing teammember's direct reports in 1:1 calls.
2. Key stakeholders: The CEO will reach out to his direct reports about the departing teammember's departure.
3. Announcement: Charlie will make an announcement during the "🌈 Weekly Update" post on Friday in the `#general` channel on Slack.
