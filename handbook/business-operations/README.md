# Business Operations
Welcome to the Business Operations (or BizOps) handbook! The BizOps handbook serves as an informational, how-to guide for Fleeties, and supports Fleet's mission by enabling team members to make meaningful contributions in alignment with our values. If you can not find what you are looking for please use the [intake process](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/business-operations#intake) to make a request of the team.

The BizOps department works together as one team, made up of these traditional functions: [People](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/business-operations/people-operations), Finance, Legal, IT, and Revenue Operations (RevOps).

## Intake
To make a request of the business operations department, [create an issue using one of our issue templates](https://github.com/fleetdm/confidential/issues/new/choose).  If you don't see what you need, or you are unsure, [create a custom request issue](https://github.com/fleetdm/confidential/issues/new/choose) and someone in business operations will reply within 1 business day.

> If you're not sure that your request can wait that long, then please ask for urgent help in our group Slack channel: `#g-business-operations`.  Only use this approach or at-mention contributors in business operations directly in urgent situations.  Otherwise, create an issue.

## Kanban
Any Fleet team member can [view the 🔦#g-business-operations kanban board](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/-g-business-operations-63f3dc3cc931f6247fcf55a9/board?sprints=none) (confidential) for this department, including pending tasks in the active sprint and any new requests.

### Key reviews
Every release cycle, each department leader prepares a [key review deck](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/key-review/#purpose) and presents it to the CEO. In this deck, the department will highlight KPI metrics (numbers measuring everyday excellence) and progress of timebound goals for a particular quarter (OKRs). The information for creating this deck is located in the ["🌈 Fleet" Google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lizTSi7YotG_zA7zJeHuOXTg_KF1Ji8k) using ["How to create key review"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PDwJL0HiCz-KbEGZMfldAYX_aLk5OVAU1MMSgMYYF2A/edit?usp=sharing)(internal doc).

> TODO: extrapolate "key reviews" to fleetdm.com/handbook/company/why-this-way -- maybe a section on "why measure KPIs and set goals?"

### All hands
Every month, Fleet holds a company-wide meeting called the "All hands".

All team members should attend the "All hands" every month.  Team members who cannot attend are expected to watch the [recording](https://us-65885.app.gong.io/conversations?workspace-id=9148397688380544352&callSearch=%7B%22search%22%3A%7B%22type%22%3A%22And%22%2C%22filters%22%3A%5B%7B%22type%22%3A%22CallTitle%22%2C%22phrase%22%3A%22all%20hands%22%7D%5D%7D%7D) within a few days.

"All hands" meetings are [recorded](https://us-65885.app.gong.io/conversations?workspace-id=9148397688380544352&callSearch=%7B%22search%22%3A%7B%22type%22%3A%22And%22%2C%22filters%22%3A%5B%7B%22type%22%3A%22CallTitle%22%2C%22phrase%22%3A%22all%20hands%22%7D%5D%7D%7D) and have [slides](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cw_lL3_Xu9ZOXKGPghh8F4tc0ND9kQeY) available.

## Trust
Fleet is successful because of our customers and community, and those relationships are built on trust.

### Security
Security policies are best when they're alive, in context in how an organization operates.  Fleeties carry Yubikeys, and change control of policies and access control is driven primarily through GitOps and SSO.

Here are a few different entry points for a tour of Fleet's security policies and best practices:
1. [Security policies](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/security/security-policies#security-policies)
2. [Human resources security policy](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/security/security-policies#human-resources-security-policy)
3. [Account recovery process](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/security#account-recovery-process)
4. [Personal mobile devices](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/security#personal-mobile-devices)
5. [Hardware security keys](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/security#hardware-security-keys)
6. More details about internal security processes at Fleet are located on [the Security page](./security.md).


## Slack channels
These groups maintain the following [Slack channels](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/why-this-way#why-group-slack-channels):

## Finance Operations

### Spending company money
As we continue to expand our company policies, we use [GitLab's open expense policy](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/spending-company-money/) as a guide for company spending.
In brief, this means that as a Fleet team member, you may:
* Spend company money like it is your own money.
* Be responsible for what you need to purchase or expense to do your job effectively.
* Feel free to make purchases __in the company's interest__ without asking for permission beforehand (when in doubt, do __inform__ your manager prior to purchase or as soon as possible after the purchase).
For more developed thoughts about __spending guidelines and limits__, please read [GitLab's open expense policy](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/spending-company-money/).

#### Brex

##### Travel
###### Attending conferences or company travel
When attending a conference or traveling for Fleet, keep the following in mind:
- $100 allowance per day for your own personal food and beverage. **(There are many good reasons to make exceptions to this guideline, such as dinners with customers.  Before proceeding, please [request approval from the Head of Business Operations](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/business-operations#intake).**
- We highly recommend you order a physical Brex card if you do not have one before attending the conference.
- The monthly limit on your Brex card may need to be increased temporarily as necessary to accommodate the increased spending associated with the conference, such as travel.  You can [request that here](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/business-operations#intake) by providing the following information:
  - The start and end dates for your trip.
  - The price of your flight (feel free to optimize a direct flight if there is one that is less than double the price of the cheapest non-direct flight).
  - The price of your hotel per night (dry cleaning is allowable if the stay is over 3 days).
  - The price of the admission fees if attending a conference.
- Please use your personal credit card for movies, mini bars, and entertainment.  These expenses _will not_ be reimbursed.

##### Non-travel purchases that exceed a Brex cardholder's limit
For non-travel purchases that would require an increase in the Brex cardholder's limit, please [make a request](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/business-operations#intake) with following information:
- The nature of the purchase (i.e. SaaS subscription and what it's used for)
- The cost of the purchase and whether it is a fixed or variable (i.e. use-based) cost.
- Whether it is a one time purchase or a recurring purchase and at what frequency the purchase will re-occur (annually, monthly, etc.)
- If there are more ideal options to pay for the purchase (i.e. bill.com, the Fleet AP Brex card, etc.) that method will be used instead.  
- In general, recurring purchases such as subscription services that will continually stretch the spend limit on a cardholder's Brex card should be paid through other means. 
- For one time purchases where payment via credit card is the most convenient then the card limit will be temporarily increased to accomodate the purchase.  

#### Reimbursements
Fleet does not reimburse expenses. We provide all of our team members with Brex cards for making purchases for the company. For company expenses, **use your Brex card.**  If there was an extreme accident, [get help](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/business-operations#intake).

<!-- 
No longer supported.  -mike, CEO, 2023-04-26.

Fleet will reimburse team members who pay for work-related expenses with their personal funds.
Team members can request reimbursement through [Gusto]([https://app.gusto.com/expenses](https://support.gusto.com/article/209831449100000/Get-reimbursed-for-expenses-as-an-employee)) if they're in the US or [Pilot]([https://pilot.co/](https://help.pilot.co/en/articles/4658204-how-to-request-a-reimbursement#:~:text=If%20you%20made%20a%20purchase,and%20click%20'Add%20new%20expense.)) if they are an international team member. When submitting an expense report, team members need to provide the receipt and a description of the expense.
Operations will review the expense and reach out to the team member if they have any questions. The reimbursement will be added to the team member's next payroll when an expense is approved.
>Pilot handles reimbursements differently depending on if the international team member is classified as an employee or a contractor. If the reimbursement is for a contractor, Operations will need to add the expense reimbursement to an upcoming recurring payment or schedule the reimbursement as an off-cycle payment. If the reimbursement is for an employee, no other action is needed; Pilot will add the reimbursement to the team member's next payroll.  -->

### Individualized expenses
Recurring expenses related to a particular team member, such as coworking fees, are called _individualized expenses_.  These expenses are still considered [non-personnel expenses](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1X-brkmUK7_Rgp7aq42drNcUg8ZipzEiS153uKZSabWc/edit#gid=2112277278), with a few extra considerations:

- Non-recurring (one-off) expenses such as an Uber ride from the airport are NOT considered "individualized".
- Seat licenses for tools like Salesforce or GitHub are NOT considered "individualized".
- Individualized expenses should include the team member's name explicitly in the name of the expense.
- If multiple team members use the same vendor for an individualized expense (for example, "WeWork"), use a separate row for each individualized expense.  (For example: "Coworking, Mungojerry (WeWork)" and "Coworking, Jennyanydots (WeWork)")
- Individualized expenses are always attributed to the  "🔦 Business operations" department.
- These expenses are still considered non-personnel expenses, in the same way seat licenses for tools like Salesforce or GitHub are considered non-personnel expenses.

### Taxes and compliance

From time to time, you may get notices in the mail from the IRS and/or state agencies regarding your company’s withholding and/or unemployment tax accounts. You can resolve many of these notices on your own by verifying and/or updating the settings in your Gusto account. 
If the notice is regarding an upcoming change to your deposit schedule or unemployment tax rate, Mike McNeil will make the change in Gusto. Including: 
 - Update your unemployment tax rate.
 - Update your federal deposit schedule.
 - Update your state deposit schedule.
**Important** Agencies do not send notices to Gusto directly, so it’s important that you read and take action before any listed deadlines or effective dates of requested changes.
Notices you should report to Gusto.
If you can't resolve the notice on your own, are unsure what the notice is in reference to, or the tax notice has a missing payment or balance owed, follow the steps in the Report and upload a tax notice in Gusto.
In Gusto, click **How to review your notice** to help you understand what kind of notice you received and what additional action you can take to help speed up the time it takes to resolve the issue.
For more information about how Fleet and our accounting team work together, check out [Fleet - who does what](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FFOudmHmfVFIk-hdIWoPFsvMPmsjnRB8/edit#gid=829046836) (private doc).

#### State quarterly payroll and tax filings
Every quarter, payroll and tax filings are due for each state. Gusto can handle these automatically if Third-party authorization (TPA) is enabled. Each state is unique and Gusto has a library of [State registration and resources](https://support.gusto.com/hub/Employers-and-admins/Taxes-forms-and-compliance/State-registration-and-resources) available to review. 
You will need to grant Third-party authorization (TPA) per state and this should be checked quarterly before the filing due dates to ensure that Gusto can file on time. 

#### CorpNet state registration process
In CorpNet, select "place an order for an existing business" we’ll need to have Foreign Registration and Payroll Tax Registration done.
  - You can have CorpNet do this by emailing the account rep "Subject: Fleet Device Management: State - Foreign Registration and Payroll Tax Registration" (this takes about two weeks).
  - You can do this between you and CorpNet by selecting "Foreign Qualification," placing the order and emailing the confirmation to the rep for Payroll registration (this is a short turnaround).
  - You can do this on your own by visiting the state's "Secretary of State" website and checking that the company name is available. To register online, you'll need the EIN, business address, information about the owners and their percentages, the first date of business, sales within the state, and the business type (usually get an email right away for approval ~24-48 hrs). 
For more information, check out [Fleet - who does what](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FFOudmHmfVFIk-hdIWoPFsvMPmsjnRB8/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=102440584423243016963&rtpof=true&sd=true).

### Finance rituals

#### Payroll
Many of these processes are automated, but it's vital to check Gusto and Pilot manually for accuracy.
 - Salaried fleeties are automated in Gusto and Pilot
 - Hourly fleeties and consultants are a manual process in Gusto and Pilot.

| Unique payrolls              | Action                       | DRI                          |
|:-----------------------------|:-----------------------------|:-----------------------------|
| Commissions and ramp         | "Off-cycle" payroll          | Nathan
| Sign-on bonus                | "Bonus" payroll              | Mike McNeil
| Performance bonus            | "Bonus" payroll              | Mike McNeil                     
| Accelerations (quarterly)    | "Off-cycle" payroll          | Nathan

Add the amount to be paid to the "Gross" line.
For Fleet's US contractors, running payroll is a manual process. 
The steps for doing this are highlighted in this loom, TODO. 
1. Time tools
2. Time tracking
3. Review hours
4. Adjust time frame to match current payroll period (the 27th through 26th of the month)
5. Sync hours
6. Run contractor payroll

##### Commission payroll

> TODO: bit more process here.  Maybe revops is DRI of commission calculator, creates "2023-03 commission payroll", transfered to Nathan when it's time to run?  SLA == payroll run by the 7th, with commission sheet 100% accurate.

- Update [commission calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vw6Q7kCC7-FdG5Fgx3ghgUdQiF2qwxk6njgK6z8_O9U/edit) with new revenue from any deals that are closed/won (have a subscription agreement signed by both parties) and have an **effective start date** within the previous month.
  - Find detailed notes on this process in [Notes - Run commission payroll in Gusto](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FQLpGxvHPW6X801HYYLPs5y8o943mmasQD3m9k_c0so/edit#). 
- Contact Mike McNeil in Slack and let her know he can run the commission payroll. Use the off-cycle payroll option in Gusto. Be sure to classify the payment as "Commission" in the "other earnings" field and not the generic "Bonus."
- Once commission payroll has been run, update the [commission calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vw6Q7kCC7-FdG5Fgx3ghgUdQiF2qwxk6njgK6z8_O9U/edit) to mark the commission as paid. 

#### Monthly rituals

##### Monthly accounting
Create a [new montly accounting issue](https://github.com/fleetdm/confidential/issues/new/choose) for the current month and year named "Closing out YYYY-MM" in GitHub and complete all of the tasks in the issue. (This uses the [monthly accounting issue template](https://github.com/fleetdm/confidential/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/5-monthly-accounting.md).

###### SLA
The monthly accounting issue should be completed and closed before the 7th of the month.
The close date is tracked each month in [KPIs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Hso0LxqwrRVINCyW_n436bNHmoqhoLhC8bcbvLPOs9A/edit).

###### When is the issue created?

We create and close the monthly accounting issue for the previous month within the first 7 days of the following month.  For example, the monthly accounting issue to close out the month of January is created promptly in February and closed before the end of the day, Feb 7th.

A convenient trick is to create the issue on the first Friday of the month and close it ASAP.

##### Recurring expenses
Recurring monthly or annual expenses are tracked as recurring, non-personnel expenses in ["🧮 The Numbers"](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1X-brkmUK7_Rgp7aq42drNcUg8ZipzEiS153uKZSabWc/edit#gid=2112277278) _(classified Google Sheet)_, along with their payment source. Reconciliation of recurring expenses happens monthly.

> Use this spreadsheet as the source of truth.  Always make changes to it first before adding or removing a recurring expense. Only track significant expenses. (Other things besides amount can make a payment significant; like it being an individualized expense, for example.)

#### Quarterly rituals

##### Quarterly Quickbooks Online (QBO) check
- Check to make sure [bookkeeping quirks](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nuUPMZb1z_lrbaQEcgjnxppnYv_GWOTTo4FMqLOlsWg/edit?usp=sharing) are all accounted for and resolved or in progress toward resolution.
- Check balance sheet and profit and loss statements (P&Ls) in QBO against the [monthly workbooks](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ben-xJgL5MlMJhIl2OeQpDjbk-pF6eJM) in Google Drive.

##### Quarterly investor reporting
- Login to Chronograph and upload our profit and loss statement (P&L), balance sheet and cash flow statements for CRV (all in one book saved in [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ben-xJgL5MlMJhIl2OeQpDjbk-pF6eJM).
- Provide updated metrics for the following items using Fleet's [KPI spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Hso0LxqwrRVINCyW_n436bNHmoqhoLhC8bcbvLPOs9A/edit#gid=0).
  - Headcount at end of the previous quarter.
  - Starting ARR for the previous quarter.
  - Total new ARR for the previous quarter.
  - "Upsell ARR" (new ARR from expansions only- Chronograph defines "upsell" as price increases for any reason.
    **- Fleet does not "upsell" anything; we deliver more value and customers enroll more hosts), downgrade ARR and churn ARR (if any) for the previous quarter.**
  - Ending ARR for the previous quarter.
  - Starting number of customers, churned customers, and the number of new customers Fleet gained during the previous quarter.
  - Total amount of Fleet customers at the end of the previous quarter.
  - Gross margin % 
    - How to calculate: total revenue for the quarter - cost of goods sold for the quarter (these metrics can be found in our books from Pilot). Chronograph will automatically conver this number to a %.
  - Net dollar retention rate
    - How to calculate: (starting ARR + new subscriptions and expansions - churn)/starting ARR. 
  - Cash burn
    - How to calculate: (start of quarter runway - end of quarter runway)/3. 

##### Equity grants
Equity grants for new hires are queued up as part of the [hiring process](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/business-operations#hiring), then grants and consents are [batched and processed quarterly](https://github.com/fleetdm/confidential/issues/new/choose).

Doing an equity grant involves:
1. executing a board consent
2. the recipient and CEO signing paperwork about the stock options
3. updating the number of shares for the recipient in the equity plan
4. updating Carta to reflect the grant

For the status of stock option grants, exercises, and all other _common stock_ including advisor, founder, and team member equity ownership, see [Fleet's equity plan](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_GJlqnWWIQBiZFOoyl9YbTr72bg5qdSSp4O3kuKm1Jc/edit#gid=0).  For information about investor ownership, see [Carta](https://app.carta.com/corporations/1234715/summary/).

> Fleet's [equity plan](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_GJlqnWWIQBiZFOoyl9YbTr72bg5qdSSp4O3kuKm1Jc/edit#gid=0) is the source of truth, not Carta.  Neither are pro formas sent in an email attachment, even if they come from lawyers.
> 
> Anyone can make mistakes, and none of us are perfect.  Even when we triple check.  Small mistakes in share counts can be hard to attribute, and can cause headaches and eat up nights of our CEO's and operations team's time.  If you notice what might be a discrepancy between the equity plan and any other secondary source of information, please speak up and let Fleet's CEO know ASAP.  Even if you're wrong, your note will be appreciated.

#### Annual rituals
##### Annual reporting for capital credit line
- Within 60 days of the end of the year:
  - Provide Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) with our balance sheet and profit and loss statement (P&L, sometimes called a cashflow statement) for the past twelve months.  
  - Provide SVB with our annual operating budgets and projections (on a quarterly basis) for the coming year.
  - Deliver this as early as possible in case they have questions.

## Legal Operations

Please submit legal questions and requests to [Business Operations department](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/business-operations#intake).
> **Note:** Escalate first-of-its-kind agreements to the CEO. Mike will review business terms and consult with lawyers as necessary.


### Getting a contract signed

If a contract is ready for signature and requires no review or revision, the requestor logins into DocuSign using hello@ from the 1Password vault and routes the agreement to the CEO for signature. 

When a contract is going to be routed for signature by someone outside of Fleet (i.e. the vendor or customer), the requestor is responsible for working with the other party to make sure the document gets routed to the CEO for signature.

The SLA for contract signature is **2 business days**. Please do not follow up on signature unless this time has elapsed.

> _**Note:** Signature open time for the CEO is not currently measured, to avoid the overhead of creating separate signature issues to measure open and close time. This may change as signature volume increases._

### Getting a contract reviewed

> If a document is ready for signature and does not need to be reviewed or negotiated, you can skip the review process and use the signature process documented above.

To get a contract reviewed, upload the agreement to [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1G1JTpFxhKZZzmn2L2RppohCX5Bv_CQ9c).

Complete the [contract review issue template in GitHub](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/business-operations#intake), being sure to include the link to the document you uploaded and using the Calendly link in the issue template to schedule time to discuss the agreement with Nathan Holliday (allowing for sufficient time for him to have reviewed the contract prior to the call).

Follow up comments should be made in the GitHub issue and in the document itself so it is all in the same place.

The SLA for contract review is **2 business days**.

Once the review is complete, the issue will be closed.

If an agreement requires an additional review during the negotiation process, the requestor will need to follow these steps again. Uploading the new draft and creating a new issue in GitHub. 

When no further review or action is required for an agreement and the document is ready to be signed, the requestor is then responsible for routing the document for signature.

### Vendor questionnaires 
In responding to security questionnaires, Fleet endeavors to provide full transparency via our [security policies](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/security/security-policies#security-policies) and [application security](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/business-operations/application-security) documentation. In addition to this documentation, please refer to [the vendor questionnaires page](./vendor-questionnaires.md) 

## IT Operations

## Tools we use

There are a number of tools that are used throughout Fleet. Some of these tools are used company-wide, while others are department-specific. You can see a list of those tools in ["Tools we use" (private Google doc)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/170qjzvyGjmbFhwS4Mucotxnw_JvyAjYv4qpwBrS6Gl8/edit?usp=sharing).


### Role-specific licenses
Certain new team members, especially in go-to-market (GTM) roles, will need paid access to paid tools like Salesforce and LinkedIn Sales Navigator immediately on their first day with the company. Gong licenses that other departments need may [request them from BizOps](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/business-operations#intake) and we will make sure there is no license redundancy in that department. The table below can be used to determine which paid licenses they will need, based on their role:

| Role                 | Salesforce CRM | Salesforce "Inbox" | LinkedIn _(paid)_ | Gong _(paid)_ | Zoom _(paid)_ |
|:-----------------|:--|:---|:---|:---|:--|
| 🐋 AE            | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅
| 🐋 CSM           | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅
| 🐋 SA            | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅
| 🫧 SDR           | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌
| ⚗️ PM             | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅
| 🔦 CEO           | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅
|   Other roles    | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌

> **Warning:** Do NOT buy LinkedIn Recruiter. AEs and SDRs should use their personal Brex card to purchase the monthly [Core Sales Navigator](https://business.linkedin.com/sales-solutions/compare-plans) plan. Fleet does not use a company wide Sales Navigator account. The goal of Sales Navigator is to access to profile views and data, not InMail.  Fleet does not send InMail. 

#### Salesforce 
We consider Salesforce to be our Rolodex for customer information.

Here are the steps we take to grant appropriate Salesforce licenses to a new hire:
1. Go to ["My Account"](https://fleetdm.lightning.force.com/lightning/n/standard-OnlineSalesHome).
2. View contracts -> pick current contract.
3. Add the desired number of licenses.
4. Sign DocuSign sent to the email.
5. The order will be processed in ~30m.
6. Once the basic license has been added, you can create a new user using the new team member's `@fleetdm.com` email and assign a license to it.
7. To also assign a user an "Inbox license", go to the ["Setup" page](https://fleetdm.lightning.force.com/lightning/setup/SetupOneHome/home) and select "User > Permission sets". Find the [inbox permission set](https://fleetdm.lightning.force.com/lightning/setup/PermSets/page?address=%2F005%3Fid%3D0PS4x000002uUn2%26isUserEntityOverride%3D1%26SetupNode%3DPermSets%26sfdcIFrameOrigin%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Ffleetdm.lightning.force.com%26clc%3D1) and assign it to the new team member.


#### Gong
Capturing video from meetings with customers, prospects, and community members outside the company is an important part of building world-class sales and customer success teams and is a widespread practice across the industry. At Fleet, we use Gong to capture Zoom meetings and share them company-wide. If a team member with a Gong license attends certain meetings, generally those with at least one person from outside of Fleet in attendance.  
  - While some Fleeties may have a Gong seat that is necessary in their work, the typical use case at Fleet is for employees on the company's sales, customer success, or customer support teams. 
  - You should be notified anytime you join a recorded call with an audio message announcing "this meeting is being recorded" or "recording in progress."  To stop a recording, the host of the call can press "Stop." 
  - If the call has external participants and is recorded, this call is stored in Gong for future use. 
To access a recording saved in Gong, visit [app.gong.io](https://app.gong.io) and sign in with SSO. 
  - Everyone at Fleet has access, whether they have a Gong seat or not, and you can explore and search through any uploaded call transcripts unless someone marks them as private (though the best practice would be not to record any calls you don't want to be captured). 
If you ever make a mistake and need to delete something, you can delete the video in Gong or reach out to Nathan Holliday or Mike McNeil for help. They will delete it immediately without watching the video. 
  - Note that any recording stopped within 60 seconds of the start of the recording is not saved in Gong, and there will be no saved record of it. 

Most folks at Fleet should see no difference in their meetings if they aren't interfacing with external parties. 
Our goal in using Gong and recording calls is to capture insights from sales, customer, and community meetings and improve how we position and sell our product. We never intend to make anyone uncomfortable, and we hope you reach out to our DRI for Gong, Nathan Holliday, or Mike McNeil if you have questions or concerns.  

#### Troubleshooting Gong
  - In order to use Gong, the Zoom call must be hosted by someone with a Fleet email address.  
  - You cannot use Gong to record calls hosted by external parties.
  - Cloud recording in Zoom has to be turned on and unlocked company wide for Gong to function properly, because of this, there is a chance that some Gong recordings may still save in Zoom's cloud storage even if they aren't uploaded into Gong.
  - To counter this, Nathan Holliday will periodically delete all recordings found in Zoom's storage without viewing them.

>If you need help using Gong, please check out Gong Academy at [https://academy.gong.io/](https://academy.gong.io/).

##### Excluding calls from being recorded
For those with a Gong seat or scheduling a call with someone in attendance that has a Gong seat who does not wish for their Zoom call with an external party to record, make sure your calendar event title contains `[no shadows]`.  You can also read the [complete list of exclusion rules](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OOxLajvqf-on5I8viN7k6aCzqEWS2B24_mE47OefutE/edit?usp=sharing).


#### Zapier and DocuSign
We use Zapier to automate how completed DocuSign envelopes are formatted and stored. This process ensures we store signed documents in the correct folder and that filenames are formatted consistently. 
When the final signature is added to an envelope in DocuSign, it is marked as completed and sent to Zapier, where it goes through these steps:
1. Zapier sends the following information about the DocuSign envelope to our Hydroplane webhook:
   - **`emailSubject`** - The subject of the envelope sent by DocuSign. Our DocuSign templates are configured to format the email subject as `[type of document] for [signer's name]`.
   - **`emailCsv`** - A comma-separated list of signers' email addresses.
2. The Hydroplane webhook matches the document type to the correct Google Drive folder, orders the list of signers, creates a timestamp, and sends that data back to Zapier as
   - **`destinationFolderID`** - The slug for the Google Drive folder where we store this type of document.
   - **`emailCsv`** - A sorted list of signers' email addresses.
   - **`date`** - The date the document was completed in DocuSign, formatted YYYY-MM-DD.
3. Zapier uses this information to upload the file to the matched Google Drive folder, with the filename formatted as `[date] - [emailSubject] - [emailCvs].PDF`.
4. Once the file is uploaded, Zapier uses the Slack integration to post in the #peepops channel with the message:
   ```
   Now complete with all signatures:
      [email subject]
      link: drive.google.com/[destinationFolderID]
   ```

#### Namecheap

Domain name registrations are handled through Namecheap. Access is managed via 1Password.

#### Vetty

Fleet team members with access to Fleet's infrastructure undergo a background check provided through [Vetty](https://vetty.co/). Only the most recent background checks appear on the home page of Vetty's dashboard. To access a complete list of background checks run in Vetty, scroll down to the bottom of the candidates page and click "View Historical".


### Equipment
#### Laptops
##### Purchasing a company-issued device
Fleet provides laptops for core team members to use while working at Fleet. As soon as an offer is accepted, Business Operations will reach out to the new team member to start this process and will work with the new team member to get their laptop purchased and shipped to them on time.

Apple computers shipping to the United States and Canada are ordered using the Apple [eCommerce Portal](https://ecommerce2.apple.com/asb2bstorefront/asb2b/en/USD/?accountselected=true), or by contacting the business team at an Apple Store or contacting the online sales team at [800-854-3680](tel:18008543680). The business team can arrange for same-day pickup at a store local to the Fleetie if needed.

When ordering through the Apple eCommerce Portal, look for a banner with *Apple Store for FLEET DEVICE MANAGEMENT | Welcome [Your Name].* Hovering over *Welcome* should display *Your Profile.* If Fleet's account number is displayed, purchases will be automatically made available in Apple Business Manager (ABM).

Apple computers for Fleeties in other countries should be purchased through an authorized reseller to ensure the device is enrolled in ADE. In countries that Apple does not operate or that do not allow ADE, work with the authorized reseller to find the best solution, or consider shipping to a US based Fleetie and then shipping on to the teammate. 

##### Selecting a laptop
Most Fleeties use 16-inch MacBook Pros. Team members are free to choose any laptop or operating system that works for them, as long as the price [is within reason](#spending-company-money) and supported by our device management solution.  (Good news: Since Fleet uses Fleet for device management, every operating system is supported!)

When selecting a new laptop for a team member, optimize their configuration to:
1. Have a reasonably large storage (at least 512GB of storage, and if there's any concern go bigger)
2. Look for pre-configured models with the desired memory and storage requirements. These tend to be available for delivery or pickup as quickly as possible and before the start date.

> If delivery timelines are a concern with no devices in stock, play around with build until it ships as quickly as possible.  Sometimes small changes lead to much faster ship times.  More standard configurations (with fewer customizations) usually ship more quickly.  Sometimes MacBook Pros ship more quickly than MacBook Airs, and vice versa.  This varies.  Remember: Always play around with the build and optimize for something that will **ship quickly**!

For example, someone in sales, marketing, or business operations might like to use a 14-inch Macbook Air, whereas someone in an engineering, product, or design role might use a 16-inch MacBook Pro.  **Default to a 16-inch MacBook Pro.**

> A 3-year AppleCare+ Protection Plan (APP) should be considered default for Apple computers >$1500. Base MacBook Airs, Mac minis, etc. do not need APP unless configured beyond the $1500 price point. APP provides 24/7 support, and global repair coverage in case of accidental screen damage or liquid spill, and battery service.

Windows and Linux devices are available upon request for team members in product and engineering.  (See [Buying other new equipment](#buying-other-new-equipment).)

#### Buying other new equipment
At Fleet, we [spend company money like it's our own money](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/business-operations#spending-company-money).  If you need equipment above and beyond those standard guidelines, you can request new equipment by creating a GitHub issue in fleetdm/fleet and attaching the `#g-business-operations`.  Please include a link to the requested equipment (including any specs), the reason for the request, and a timeline for when the device is needed. 

#### Tracking equipment
When a device has been purchased, it's added to the [spreadsheet of company equipment](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hFlymLlRWIaWeVh14IRz03yE-ytBLfUaqVz0VVmmoGI/edit#gid=0) where we keep track of devices and equipment, purchased by Fleet.

When you receive your new computer, complete the entry by adding a description, model, and serial number to the spreadsheet.

#### Returning equipment
Equipment should be returned once offboarded for reprovisioning. Coordinate offboarding and return with the Head of Business Operations. 

#### Reprovisioning equipment
Apple computers with remaining AppleCare Protection Plans should be reprovisioned to other Fleeties who may have older or less-capable computers.

#### Equipment retention and replacement
Older equipment results in lost productivity of Fleeties and should be considered for replacement. Replacement candidates are computers that are no longer under an AppleCare+ Protection Plan (or another warranty plan), are >3 years from the [discontinued date](https://everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook_pro/index-macbookpro.html#specs), or when the "Battery condition" status in Fleet is less than "Normal". The old equipment should be evaluated for return or retention as a test environment.

> If your Apple device is less than 3 years old, has normal battery condition, but is experiencing operating difficulties, you should first contact Apple support and troubleshoot performance issues before requesting a new device.
