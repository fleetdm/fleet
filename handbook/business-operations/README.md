### Run payroll
Many of these processes are automated, but it's vital to check Gusto and Plane manually for accuracy.
 - Salaried fleeties are automated in Gusto and Plane.
 - Hourly fleeties and consultants are a manual process each month in Gusto and Plane.

| Payroll type                 | What to use                  | DRI                          |
|:-----------------------------|:-----------------------------|:-----------------------------|
| [Commissions and ramp](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/business-operations#run-us-commission-payroll)         | "Off-cycle" payroll          | Head of Business Operations
| Sign-on bonus                | "Bonus" payroll              | Head of Business Operations
| Performance bonus            | "Bonus" payroll              | Head of Business Operations     
| Accelerations (quarterly)    | "Off-cycle" payroll          | Head of Business Operations
| [US contractor payroll](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/business-operations#run-us-contractor-payroll) | "Off-cycle" payroll | Head of Business Operations

### Reconcile monthly recurring expenses
Recurring monthly or annual expenses, such as the tools we use throughout Fleet, are tracked as recurring, non-personnel expenses in ["🧮 The Numbers"](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1X-brkmUK7_Rgp7aq42drNcUg8ZipzEiS153uKZSabWc/edit#gid=2112277278) _(¶confidential Google Sheet)_, along with their payment source. Reconciliation of recurring expenses happens monthly. <!-- TODO: Merge "🧮 The Numbers" and  ["Tools we use" (private Google doc)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/170qjzvyGjmbFhwS4Mucotxnw_JvyAjYv4qpwBrS6Gl8/edit?usp=sharing) -->

> Use this spreadsheet as the source of truth.  Always make changes to it first before adding or removing a recurring expense. Only track significant expenses. (Other things besides amount can make a payment significant; like it being an individualized expense, for example.)


### Access a background check
Fleet team members with access to Fleet's infrastructure undergo a background check provided through [Vetty](https://vetty.co/). Only the most recent background checks appear on the home page of Vetty's dashboard. To access a complete list of background checks run in Vetty, scroll down to the bottom of the candidates page and click "View Historical".


### Process an email from a state agency
From time to time, you may get notices via email (or in the mail) from state agencies regarding Fleet's withholding and/or unemployment tax accounts. You can resolve some of these notices on your own by verifying and/or updating the settings in your Gusto account.

If the notice is regarding an upcoming change to your deposit schedule or unemployment tax rate, make the required change in Gusto, such as:
- Update your unemployment tax rate.
- Update your federal deposit schedule.
- Update your state deposit schedule.

In Gusto, you can click **How to review your notice** to help you understand what kind of notice you received and what additional action you can take to help speed up the time it takes to resolve the issue.

> **Note:** Many agencies do not send notices to Gusto directly, so it’s important that you read and take action before any listed deadlines or effective dates of requested changes, in case you have to do something.  If you can't resolve the notice on your own, are unsure what the notice is in reference to, or the tax notice has a missing payment or balance owed, follow the steps in the Report and upload a tax notice in Gusto.

<!-- 2023-08-19: I commented this out because I wasn't sure if we were still doing it this way and I didn't want to leave infomration that was potentially incorrect or contradictory.  -mikermcneil
#### Process an email from a state agency with help from CorpNet
In CorpNet, select "place an order for an existing business":
- Email the CorpNet account rep "Subject: Fleet Device Management: State - Foreign Registration and Payroll Tax Registration" (this takes about two weeks).
- Select "Foreign Qualification," place the order and email the confirmation to the CorpNet rep for "Payroll registration" (this is a shorter turnaround).
  - You can also do this on your own by visiting the state's "Secretary of State" website and checking that the company name is available. To register online, you'll need the EIN, business address, information about the owners and their percentages, the first date of business, sales within the state, and the business type (usually get an email right away for approval ~24-48 hrs). 
-->

<!-- 2023-08-19: This linked sheet is out of date so I'm commenting it out.  -mikermcneil
For more information about how Fleet and our accounting team work together, check out [Fleet - who does what](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FFOudmHmfVFIk-hdIWoPFsvMPmsjnRB8/edit#gid=829046836) (private doc). -->

<!-- 2023-08-19: I commented this out because I wasn't sure how to map it to an imperative mood verb phrase (responsibility) that bizops is doing either ad hoc or as part of a ritual (recurring task). -mikermcneil
Every quarter, payroll and tax filings are due for each state. Gusto can handle these automatically if Third-party authorization (TPA) is enabled. Each state is unique and Gusto has a library of [State registration and resources](https://support.gusto.com/hub/Employers-and-admins/Taxes-forms-and-compliance/State-registration-and-resources) available to review.  You will need to grant Third-party authorization (TPA) per state and this should be checked quarterly before the filing due dates to ensure that Gusto can file on time. -->


### Inform managers about hours worked
Every Friday at 1:00pm CT, we gather hours worked for anyone who gets paid hourly by Fleet. This includes core team members and consultants, regardless of employment classification, and regardless whether inside or outside of the United States.

Here's how:
- For every hourly core team member in Gusto or Plane.com, find the DRI by looking up ([who they report to](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company#org-chart)).
- If any direct report is hourly in Plane.com and does not submit their hours until the end of the month, still list them, but explain. 
- [Consultants](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/business-operations#hiring) don't have a formal reporting structure. They submit their hours through Gusto (US consultants) or Plane.com (international consultants), which require approval from a DRI. You can find the DRI by looking at the Business Operations [KPIs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Hso0LxqwrRVINCyW_n436bNHmoqhoLhC8bcbvLPOs9A/edit#gid=0)

Then, send the DRI a direct message in Slack with a screenshot of the HRIS portal, showing hours logged since last Saturday at midnight and tasks undertaken during those hours (if provided). Ensure the screenshot does not contain any compensation information.

> 
> More info: https://fleetdm.com/handbook/business-operations#inform-managers-about-hours-worked

### Change the DRI of a consultant

1. In the [KPIs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Hso0LxqwrRVINCyW_n436bNHmoqhoLhC8bcbvLPOs9A/edit#gid=0) sheet, find the consultant's column.
2. Change the DRI documented there to the new DRI who will receive information about the consultant's hours.

### Run US contractor payroll
For Fleet's US contractors, running payroll is a manual process:
- Add the amount to be paid to the "Gross" line.
- Review hours _("Time tools > Time tracking")_
- Adjust time frame to match current payroll period (the 27th through 26th of the month)
- Sync hours and run contractor payroll.

### Create an invoice
To create a new invoice for a Fleet customer, follow these steps:
1. Go to the [invoice folder in google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11limC_KQYNYQPApPoXN0CplHo_5Qgi2b?usp=drive_link).
2. Create a copy of the invoice template, and title the copy `[invoice number] Fleet invoice - [customer name]`.
    - The invoice number follows the format of `YYMMDD[daily issued invoice number]`, where the daily issued invoice number should equal `01` if it's the first invoice issued that day, `02` if it's the second, etc.
3.  Edit the new invoice to reflect details from the signed subscription agreement (and PO if required).
    - Enter the invoice number (and PO number if required) into the top right section of the invoice.
    - Update the date of the invoice to reflect the current date.
    - Make sure the payment terms match the signed subscription agreement.
    - Copy the customer address from the signed subscription agreement and input it in the "Bill to" section of the invoice.
    - Copy the "Billing contact" email from the signed subscription agreement and add it to the last line of the "Bill to" address.
    - Make sure the start and end dates of the contract and amount match the subscription agreement.
    - If professional services are included in the subscription agreement, include as a separate line in the invoice, and ensure the amounts total correctly.
    - Ensure the "Notes" section has wiring instructions for payment via SVB.
4.  Download the completed invoice as a PDF.
5.  Send the PDF to the billing contact from the "Bill to" section of the invoice and cc [Fleet's billing email address](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/communications#email-relays). Use the following template for the email:
```
Subject: Invoice for Fleet Device Management [invoice number]
Hello,

I've attached the invoice for [customer name]'s purchase of Fleet Device Management's premium subscription.
For payment instructions please refer to your invoice, and reach out to [insert Fleet's billing address] with any questions.

Thanks,
[name]
```
6. Update the opportunity in Salesforce to include the "Invoice date" as the day the invoice was sent.
7. Notify the AE/CSM that the invoice has been sent.

> Certain vendors require invoices submitted via a payment portal (such as Coupa). Once you've generated the invoice using the steps above, upload it to the relevant payment portal and email the billing contact to let them know you've submitted the invoice.


### Communicate the status of customer financial actions
This reporting is performed to update the status of open or upcoming customer actions regarding the financial health of the opportunity. To complete the report:
- Go to this [report folder](https://fleetdm.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Folder/00lUG000000DstpYAC/view?queryScope=userFolders) in SFDC. The three reports will provide the data used in the report.
- Copy the template below and paste it into the [#g-sales slack channel](https://fleetdm.slack.com/archives/C030A767HQV) and complete all "todos" using the data from Salesforce before sending. 

```
Weekly revenue report - [@`todo: CRO` and @`todo: CEO`]
- Number accounts with outstanding balances = `todo`
- Number of customers awaiting invoices = `todo`
- Number of past-due renewals = `todo`
```

- Send payment reminders via email to all outstanding accounts by responding to the invoice email initially sent to the customer.

```
Hello,
This is a reminder that you have an outstanding balance due for your Fleet Device Management premium subscription.
We have included the invoice here for your convenience.
For payment instructions please refer to your invoice, and reach out to [Fleet's billing contact] with any questions.

Thanks,
[name]
```

- If any accounts will become overdue within a week, reply in thread to the slack post, mention the opportunity owner of the account, and ask them to notify their contact that Fleet is still awaiting payment.

### Run US commission payroll
- Update [commission calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vw6Q7kCC7-FdG5Fgx3ghgUdQiF2qwxk6njgK6z8_O9U/edit) with new revenue from any deals that are closed/won (have a subscription agreement signed by both parties) and have a **Close date** within the previous month.
  - Find detailed notes on this process in [Notes - Run commission payroll in Gusto](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FQLpGxvHPW6X801HYYLPs5y8o943mmasQD3m9k_c0so/edit#). 
- Let the Head of Business Operations know they can run the commission payroll. Use the off-cycle payroll option in Gusto. Be sure to classify the payment as "Commission" in the "other earnings" field and not the generic "Bonus."
- Once commission payroll has been run, update the [commission calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vw6Q7kCC7-FdG5Fgx3ghgUdQiF2qwxk6njgK6z8_O9U/edit) to mark the commission as paid. 


### Convert a Fleetie to a consultant
If a Fleetie decides they want to move to being a [consultant](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/leadership#consultants), either the Fleetie or their manager need to create a [custom issue for the BizOps team](https://github.com/fleetdm/confidential/issues/new?assignees=&labels=%23g-business-operations&projects=&template=custom-request.md&title=Request%3A+_______________________) to notify them of the change.
Once notified, BizOps takes the following steps:
- Confirm the following details with the Fleetie:
  - Date of change
  - Term of consultancy (time period)
  - Hours/capacity expected (hours per week or month)
  - Confirm hourly rate
- Once details are confirmed, use the information given to create the consulting agreement for the Fleetie (either in docusign (US-based) or via Plane (international)), and send to their personal email for signature. Once signed, save in Fleetie's [employee file](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UL7o3BzkTKnpvIS4hm_RtbOilSABo3oG?usp=drive_link).
- Schedule the Fleetie's final day in HRIS (Gusto or Plane).
- Update final day in ["🧑‍🚀 Fleeties"](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OSLn-ZCbGSjPusHPiR5dwQhheH1K8-xqyZdsOe9y7qc/edit#gid=0) spreadsheet.
- Create an [offboarding issue](https://github.com/fleetdm/classified/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/%F0%9F%9A%AA-offboarding-____________.md) for the Fleetie converting to a consultant, and confirm with their manager if there is a need to retain any tools or access while they are a consultant (default to removing all access from Fleet email, and migrating to personal email for Slack and other tools unless there is a business case to retain the Fleet email and associated tool access).
- Follow the offboarding issue for next steps, including communicating to teammates and updating equity plan.


### Update personnel details
When a Fleetie, consultant or advisor requests an update to their personnel details (name, location, phone, etc), follow these steps to ensure accurate representation across systems.
- Team member submits a [custom issue](https://github.com/fleetdm/confidential/issues/new?assignees=&labels=%23g-business-operations&projects=&template=custom-request.md&title=Request%3A+_______________________) to update their personnel details (or BizOps team creates if the request comes via email or is sensitive and needs a classified issue).
  - If change is for a primary identification or contact method, ask for evidence of change and capture in [employee's personnel file](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UL7o3BzkTKnpvIS4hm_RtbOilSABo3oG?usp=drive_link).
- BizOps makes change to HRIS (Gusto or Plane) to reflect change. 
  - Note: if making the change requires follow up steps, resolve those steps to action the change.
- Once change is effected in HRIS, BizOps makes changes to ["🧑‍🚀 Fleeties"](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OSLn-ZCbGSjPusHPiR5dwQhheH1K8-xqyZdsOe9y7qc/edit#gid=0) spreadsheet.
- If required, BizOps makes any relevant changes to [Fleet's equity plan](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_GJlqnWWIQBiZFOoyl9YbTr72bg5qdSSp4O3kuKm1Jc/edit#gid=0).
- If required, BizOps makes any relevant changes to the ["🗺️ Geographical factors"](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rCVCs-eOo-VSEG7fPLgdq5l7oSaActl5bewaWP7PnSE/edit#gid=1533353559) spreadsheet and follows through on any action items involving tax implications (i.e. registering with a new state for employer taxes).
- If required, BizOps also makes changes to other core systems (e.g: creating a new email alias in google workspace; updating details in Carta; etc).
- The change is now actioned, notify the team member and close the issue.

> Note: if the Fleetie is US based and has a qualifying life event that impacts benefit coverage, they can [follow the Gusto steps](https://support.gusto.com/article/100895878100000/Change-your-benefits-with-a-qualifying-life-event) to update their coverage elections.

### Change a Fleetie's job title
When BizOps receives notification of a Fleetie's job title changing, follow these steps to ensure accurate recording of the change across our systems.
- Update ["🧑‍🚀 Fleeties"](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OSLn-ZCbGSjPusHPiR5dwQhheH1K8-xqyZdsOe9y7qc/edit#gid=0):
  - Search the spreadsheet for the Fleetie in need of a job title change.
  - Input the new job title in the Fleetie's row in the "Job title" cell.
  - Navigate to the "Org chart" tab of the spreadsheet, and verify that the Fleetie's title appears correctly in the org chart.
- Update the departmental handbook page with the change of job title
- Update the relevant payroll/HRIS system.
  - For updating Gusto (US-based Fleeties):
    - Login to Gusto and navigate to "People > Team members".
    - Find the Fleetie and select them to see their profile page.
    - Under the "Compensation" heading, select edit and update the "Job title" and input the specific date the change happened. Save the changes.
  - For updating Plane (non-US Fleeties):
    - Login to Plane and navigate to "People > Team".
    - Find the Fleetie and select them to see their profile page.
    - Use the "Help" function, or email support@plane.com to notify Plane of the need to change the job title for the Fleetie. Include the Fleetie's name, current title, new title, and effective date.
    - Take any relevant steps as directed by Plane in order to make the required changes to the Fleetie's profile.


### Change a Fleetie's manager
When BizOps receives notification of a Fleetie's manager changing, follow these steps to ensure correct recording in our systems.
- Update [🧑‍🚀 Fleeties](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OSLn-ZCbGSjPusHPiR5dwQhheH1K8-xqyZdsOe9y7qc/edit#gid=0):
  - Search for the Fleetie's new manager, and copy the new manager's unique ID from the far left "Unique ID" column.
  - Search for the Fleetie who's manager is changing, and paste (without formatting) their new manager's unique ID in the "Reports to: (manager unique ID)" cell in the Fleetie's row.
  - Verify that the "Reports to (auto: manager name and job title)" cell in the Fleetie's row reflects the new manager's details.
  - Verify that in the new manager's row, the "# direct reports" cell reflect the correct number.
  - Navigate to the "Org chart" tab in the spreadsheet, and verify that the Fleetie now appears in the correct place in the org chart.
- If the person's department is changing, then update both departmental handbook pages to move the person to their new department:
  - Remove the person from the "Team" section of the old department and add them to the "Team" section of the new department.
- If the person's level of confidential access will change along with the change to their manager, then update that level of access:
  - Update Google Workspace to make sure this person lives in the correct Google Group, removing them from the old and/or adding them to the new.
  - Update 1password to remove this person from old vaults and/or add them to new vaults.
  - For a team member moving from "classified" to "confidential" access, check Gusto, Plane, and other systems to remove their access.

> **Note:** The Fleeties spreadsheet is the source of truth for who everyone's manager is and their job titles.
 


### Prepare salary benchmarking information
- Use the relevant template text in the README section of the [¶¶ 💌 Compensation decisions document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NQ-IjcOTbyFluCWqsFLMfP4SvnopoXDcX0civ-STS5c/edit?usp=sharing) for a current Fleetie, a new role, a prospective hire, or other benchmarking use case.
- Copy the template text and paste at the end of the document.
- Fill in details as required, pulling from [🧑‍🚀 Fleeties spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OSLn-ZCbGSjPusHPiR5dwQhheH1K8-xqyZdsOe9y7qc/edit#gid=0) and [equity spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_GJlqnWWIQBiZFOoyl9YbTr72bg5qdSSp4O3kuKm1Jc/edit?usp=sharing) as required.
- Use the teammate's information to benchmark in [Pave](https://www.pave.com/) (login details in 1Password). You can pattern match from previous benchmarking entries, and include all company assumtions. Add the direct link to the Pave benchmark.

### Update a team member's compensation
To [change a team member's compensation](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/communications#compensation-changes), follow these steps:
- Create a copy of the ["Values assessment" template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1P5TyRV2v-YN0aR_X8vd8GksKcr3uHfUDdshqpVzamV8/edit?usp=drive_link) and move it to the team member's [personnel folder in Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UL7o3BzkTKnpvIS4hm_RtbOilSABo3oG?usp=drive_link).
- Share the values assessment document with the manager and ask them to perform the values assessment.
- Once the values assessment is complete, [prepare salary benchmarking information](#prepare-salary-benchmarking-information) and set a meeting between the manager, head of department, and Head of Business Operations about level of job skill in relation to compensation benchmarking levels.
- Schedule a new calendar event for the Head of Business Operations with the founders over an existing founders' 1:1 to discuss if an adjustment needs to be made to team member's compensation to align with benchmarking. During the 1:1 call, founders review values assessment, benchmarking for role and geography, and decide if there will be an adjustment.
- Head of Business Operations will post in slack to `#help-classified` with the decision on compensation changes and effective date, if any.
- Communicate via Slack DM the decision to the teammate's people manager, who will then communicate to their teammate.
- Update the respective payroll platform (Gusto or Plane) by navigating to the personnel page, selecting salary field, and updating with an effective date that makes the next payroll.
- Update the [equity spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_GJlqnWWIQBiZFOoyl9YbTr72bg5qdSSp4O3kuKm1Jc/edit?usp=sharing) (internal doc) by copying existing OTE to the bottom of the "Notes" cell, updating the OTE column with the new compensation information, and updating the "Last compensation change" column with the effective date from payroll platform.

> If the company decides on an additional equity grant as part of a compensation change, note the previous equity and new situation in detail in the "Notes" column of the equity plan. Update the "Grant started?" column to "todo" which adds it to the queue for the next time grants are processed (quarterly).


### Process monthly accounting
Create a [new montly accounting issue](https://github.com/fleetdm/confidential/issues/new/choose) for the current month and year named "Closing out YYYY-MM" in GitHub and complete all of the tasks in the issue. (This uses the [monthly accounting issue template](https://github.com/fleetdm/confidential/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/5-monthly-accounting.md).

- **SLA:** The monthly accounting issue should be completed and closed before the 7th of the month.
- The close date is tracked each month in [KPIs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Hso0LxqwrRVINCyW_n436bNHmoqhoLhC8bcbvLPOs9A/edit).
- **When is the issue created?** We create and close the monthly accounting issue for the previous month within the first 7 days of the following month.  For example, the monthly accounting issue to close out the month of January is created promptly in February and closed before the end of the day, Feb 7th.  A convenient trick is to create the issue on the first Friday of the month and close it ASAP.

### Check franchise tax status
No later than the second month of every quarter, we check [Delaware divison of corporations](https://icis.corp.delaware.gov) to ensure that Fleet has paid the quarterly franchise tax amounts to remain in good standing with the state of Delaware.
- Go to the [DCIS - eCorp website](https://icis.corp.delaware.gov/ecorp/logintax.aspx?FilingType=FranchiseTax) and use the details in 1Password to look up Fleet's status.
- If no outstanding amounts: the tax has been paid.
- If outstanding amounts shown: ensure payment before due date to avoid penalties, interest, and entering bad standing.

### Check finances for quirks
Every quarter, we check Quickbooks Online (QBO) for discrepancies and follow up on quirks.
- Check to make sure [bookkeeping quirks](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nuUPMZb1z_lrbaQEcgjnxppnYv_GWOTTo4FMqLOlsWg/edit?usp=sharing) are all accounted for and resolved or in progress toward resolution.
- Check balance sheet and profit and loss statements (P&Ls) in QBO against the latest [monthly workbooks](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ben-xJgL5MlMJhIl2OeQpDjbk-pF6eJM) in Google Drive.
- Reach out to Pilot with any differences or quirks, and ask them to resolve/provide clarity.  This often will need to happen over a call to review sycnhronously.
- Once quirks are resolved, note the day it was resolved in the spreadsheet.

### Report quarterly numbers in Chronograph
Follow these steps to perform quarterly reporting for Fleet's investors:
- Login to Chronograph and upload our profit and loss statement (P&L), balance sheet and cash flow statements for CRV (all in one book saved in [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ben-xJgL5MlMJhIl2OeQpDjbk-pF6eJM).
- Provide updated metrics for the following items using Fleet's [KPI spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Hso0LxqwrRVINCyW_n436bNHmoqhoLhC8bcbvLPOs9A/edit#gid=0).
  - Headcount at end of the previous quarter.
  - Starting ARR for the previous quarter.
  - Total new ARR for the previous quarter.
  - "Upsell ARR" (new ARR from expansions only- Chronograph defines "upsell" as price increases for any reason.
    **- Fleet does not "upsell" anything; we deliver more value and customers enroll more hosts), downgrade ARR and churn ARR (if any) for the previous quarter.**
  - Ending ARR for the previous quarter.
  - Starting number of customers, churned customers, and the number of new customers Fleet gained during the previous quarter.
  - Total amount of Fleet customers at the end of the previous quarter.
  - Gross margin % 
    - How to calculate: (total revenue for the quarter - cost of goods sold for the quarter)/total revenue for the quarter (these metrics can be found in our books from Pilot). Chronograph will automatically conver this number to a %.
  - Net dollar retention rate
    - How to calculate: (starting ARR + new subscriptions and expansions - churn)/starting ARR. 
  - Cash burn
    - How to calculate: start of quarter runway - end of quarter runway. 


### Grant equity
Equity grants for new hires are queued up as part of the [hiring process](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/business-operations#hiring), then grants and consents are [batched and processed quarterly](https://github.com/fleetdm/confidential/issues/new/choose).

Doing an equity grant involves:
- Executing a board consent
- The recipient and CEO signing paperwork about the stock options
- Updating the number of shares for the recipient in the equity plan
- Updating Carta to reflect the grant

For the status of stock option grants, exercises, and all other _common stock_ including advisor, founder, and team member equity ownership, see [Fleet's equity plan](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_GJlqnWWIQBiZFOoyl9YbTr72bg5qdSSp4O3kuKm1Jc/edit#gid=0).  For information about investor ownership, see [Carta](https://app.carta.com/corporations/1234715/summary/).

> Fleet's [equity plan](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_GJlqnWWIQBiZFOoyl9YbTr72bg5qdSSp4O3kuKm1Jc/edit#gid=0) is the source of truth, not Carta.  Neither are pro formas sent in an email attachment, even if they come from lawyers.
> 
> Anyone can make mistakes, and none of us are perfect.  Even when we triple check.  Small mistakes in share counts can be hard to attribute, and can cause headaches and eat up nights of our CEO's and operations team's time.  If you notice what might be a discrepancy between the equity plan and any other secondary source of information, please speak up and let Fleet's CEO know ASAP.  Even if you're wrong, your note will be appreciated.


### Deliver annual report for venture line
Within 60 days of the end of the year, follow these steps:
  - Provide Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) with our balance sheet and profit and loss statement (P&L, sometimes called a cashflow statement) for the past twelve months.  
  - Provide SVB with our board-approved annual operating budgets and projections (on a quarterly granularity) for the new year.
  - Deliver this as early as possible in case they have questions.


### Process a new vendor invoice
- After making sure that an invoice received from a new vendor is valid, add the new vendor to the recurring expenses section of ["The numbers"](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1X-brkmUK7_Rgp7aq42drNcUg8ZipzEiS153uKZSabWc/edit#gid=2112277278) before paying the invoice.


### Process a request to cancel a vendor
- Make the cancellation notification in accordance with the contract terms between Fleet and the vendor, typically these notifications are made via email and may have a specific address that notice must be sent to. If the vendor has an autorenew contract with Fleet there will often be a window of time in which Fleet can cancel, if notification is made after this time period Fleet may be obligated to pay for the subsequent year even if we don't use the vendor during the next contract term.  
- Once cancelled, update the recurring expenses section of [The Numbers](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1X-brkmUK7_Rgp7aq42drNcUg8ZipzEiS153uKZSabWc/edit#gid=2112277278) to reflect the cancellation by changing the projected monthly burn in column G to $0 and adding "CANCELLED" in front of the vendor's name in column C.

### Update weekly KPIs
- Create the weekly update issue from the template in ZenHub every Friday and update the [KPIs for BizOps](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Hso0LxqwrRVINCyW_n436bNHmoqhoLhC8bcbvLPOs9A/edit#gid=0) by 5pm US central time.
- Check the KPI sheet at 5pm US central time to ensure all departments have updated their KPIs on time.  If any departments are delinquent, notify the department head and let the [Apprentice to the CEO](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/ceo#team) know so they can put it on the agenda for their next one-on-one with the CEO.
