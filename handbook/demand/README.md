## Responsibilities
The Demand department is directly responsible for growing awareness of Fleet and nurturing the community through participation in events, conversations, and other [programs](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/communications#programs).

### Begin or modify an advertising campaign
Any new ads or changes to current running ads are approved in ["🦢🗣 Design review (#g-website)"](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/g-website-6451748b4eb15200131d4bab/board?sprints=none).

To propose an ad, or a change to an ad:
1. Add your change for review to the "Design review" agenda and attend the next scheduled website design review.  During the meeting, existing ads will be compared against the newly proposed ads within the corresponding ad platform. ([Google Ads](https://ads.google.com/home/), [LinkedIn Campaign Manager](https://www.linkedin.com/campaignmanager/), etc.)
2. Make revisions and re-attend the meeting as needed until the planned change is settled.
3. Execute the planned change.
4. Create a calendar reminder to check ad performance two weeks from the date changes were made.


### Optimize ads through experimentation
Fleet improves click-through rates in their campaigns to make the most of their advertising budget and attract more engaged users, boosting product adoption and community participation.

[**Google Ads**:](https://ads.google.com/home/) Ad experimentation on Google Ads for better click-through rate (CTR)
1. Duplicate the ad with the highest CTR. (If there are already two ads running, pause the ad with the lower CTR.)
2. Test one headline change for two weeks
3. Pause the ad with the lower CTR
4. Duplicate best-performing ad
5. Test one description change for two weeks
6. Pause the ad with the lower CTR
7. Repeat this process

[**LinkedIn**:](https://www.linkedin.com/campaignmanager/) Ad experimentation on LinkedIn Campaign Manager for better click-through rate (CTR)
1. Duplicate the ad with the highest CTR. (If there are already two ads running, pause the ad with the lower CTR.)
2. Test one intro text change for two weeks
3. Pause the ad with the lower CTR
4. Duplicate best-performing ad
5. Test headline change for two weeks
6. Pause the ad with the lower CTR
7. Repeat this process



### Process pending swag requests from the website
On a weekly basis, log in to [Printful](https://www.printful.com/) and complete any draft orders so that they are sent. We currently only ship within the 48 contiguous United States and approve one free order per household under normal circumstances.
To do this:
1. Go to the ["Orders"](https://www.printful.com/ca/dashboard/default/orders) page in Printful
2. Look for an order status of "Draft" and click that order.
3. Copy the address displayed in the draft order. Close the modal.
4. Under "Order list", there's a search box for customers that you will need to paste the address.
5. The results should only display one order. Any additional could be duplicate orders or those made in error.
6. Repeat this process until all remaining draft orders show "Waiting for Fulfillment"

### Send one-off swag
There are many times in which community members, customers, and contributors are in need of some cool Fleet swag. We use [Postal](https://www.postal.com/) to fulfill these swag requests. Postal warehouses Fleet swag that is available to send directly. There are two main ways to send swag through Postal: Direct sends and "Magic links".

**Magic links**: This is a great option to send when we only know the item we'd like to send and want the recipient to fill out their own contact information and shipping details. These links can be used by anyone who has access to the link, so only send to the desired recipient.

- Log in to [Postal](https://app.postal.io/items/postals) and make sure "Approved items" is checked in the top left.
- For approved items, hover over the item you want to send and click the chain icon.
- Make sure order limit is 1
- Personalize your magic link page with a customized header or message if you'd like.
- Continue on to "Review" and "Create MagicLink"

**Direct send**: This is a great option to send when we already have the name, address, and email address of the person we are sending an item to.

- Log in to [Postal](https://app.postal.io/items/postals) and make sure "Approved items" is checked in the top left.
- For approved items, hover over the item you want to send and click the paper airplane icon.
- Choose the "Direct" tab and find an existing contact or create a new one.
- To create a new contact, click the plus sign and fill out the name, email, and shipping address.
- Select "Configure your item," continue to "Review," and "Confirm and Send."

### Send swag for community contributions to Fleet
- Reach out to the contributor to thank them for their contribution
- Consider sharing the contribution on social media
- Ask if we could send the contributor any swag
- If yes, follow the steps of creating a magic link in Postal to send.

### Run a new ad or change an existing ad
Any changes to the current running ads visible to a user, including designs, keywords, or targeting, are approved in 🦢🗣 Design review (#g-website), which [occurs regularly](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/product-groups#design-reviews) and is open to all fleeties.
1. [Head of Demand Generation](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/demand#team) adds a discussion item about the change to the [website design review agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q73ublh9bcIL01JsY--gpZRd3KPT_KCX-F0RaorKJcM/edit)
2. During the call, they compare existing ads against the planned updates within the corresponding ad platform. ([Google Ads](https://ads.google.com/home/), [LinkedIn Campaign Manager](https://www.linkedin.com/campaignmanager/), etc.)
3. [Head of Demand Generation](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/demand#team) makes changes and creates a calendar reminder to check performance either two weeks or four weeks from the date changes were made.


> **Do changes to keywords or targeting require a design review?** Currently, all changes to these things require discussion with our product marketer.
