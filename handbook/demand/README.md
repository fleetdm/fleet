## Responsibilities

The Demand department is directly responsible for achieving revenue pipeline targets, increasing awareness and interest in the open-source project, and nurturing the Fleet community through participation in video, sponsored events, and other [programs](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/communications#programs).


### Refresh event calendar

Fleet's public relations firm is directly responsible for the accuracy of event locations, attendance dates, and CFP deadlines in the event strategy workbook.  At the end of every quarter, the PR firm updates every event in the ["Event strategy workbook"](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YQXAX2Q_WnGkAwMYjMbQpV3nbCj7gOBbv7Y0u4twxzQ/edit) (private Google doc) by following these steps:
1. Visit the latest website for each event.
2. Update the workbook with the latest location, dates, and CFP deadlines from the website.


### Begin or modify an advertising campaign

Any new ads or changes to current running ads are approved in ["🦢🗣 Design review (#g-digital-experience)"](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/-g-digital-experience-6451748b4eb15200131d4bab/board?sprints=none).

To propose an ad, or a change to an ad:
1. Evaluate the buying situation before proposing any changes to ads. This determines the audience that will see each ad and which campaign it will be placed in. (Device management, vuln management, endpoint ops - security, endpoint ops - IT)
2. Experiment campaigns must follow the YYYY-MM-DD._{buying_situation}-{ad_name}_ format. (2024-01-12.mdm - Cross-platform MDM waitlist)
3. Image ads should follow the recommended size, centering, and asset guidelines. These are available on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/1J2yxqH8Q7u8V7YTtA1iej/Social-media-(logos%2C-covers%2C-banners)?type=design&node-id=2078-100840&mode=design&t=cHriEw2E7hLxgwuG-0).
4. Add your proposed ads to the ["🧫 Experiment review" agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e2TFsV0JFFym7MvCUrJR1Wr2DVmqUgboKYFUXBEmCyI/edit#heading=h.kvp9pcc0kkq) (private Google doc) and attend the next episode.  During the meeting, existing ads will be compared against the newly proposed ads within the corresponding ad platform. ([Google Ads](https://ads.google.com/home/), [LinkedIn Campaign Manager](https://www.linkedin.com/campaignmanager/), etc.)
5. Make revisions and re-attend the meeting as needed until the planned change is executed.
7. Create a calendar reminder to check ad performance two weeks from the date changes were made.


### Measure intent signals

Intent signals help measure an individual's current level of engagement with the Fleet brand. Use the following steps to decide if:  

(a) A contact and/or account needs to be created/updated. 

(b) An account should be prioritized for [manual research](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/demand#research-an-account).

(c) An account/contact would benefit from a sales conversation.

(in order of how worthwhile it is to spend time looking at the intent signal)

1. Accounts currently assigned to reps (i.e. pipeline + stage0 + pre-pipeline IQMs).
2. Accounts with trending psychological progression (as measured by fleetdm.com website signups (i.e. new contacts ± contacts that have increased their psystage to a certain point).
3. Accounts that fleeties have suggested to go after in ABM maneuver sheet.
4. [MacAdmins Slack traffic](https://macadmins.slack.com/archives/C0214NELAE7/p1722561481530559) in the #fleet AND #osquery channels (channel joins, posts, reactions, thread replies, thread reactions).
5. [LinkedIn page follows](https://www.linkedin.com/company/71111416/admin/analytics/followers/).
6. [GitHub stars to fleetdm/fleet](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/stargazers) from non-fleeties.


### Research an account

Follow these steps to research an account and move it toward sales-readiness **after** discovering [relevant intent signals](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/demand#measure-intent-signals).

1. Create the account in SalesForce if it doesn't already exist.
2. Update any incorrect, mistagged, or incomplete contacts already on the account and merge any duplicates that are found. Verify the following data is current for each existing contact:
  - "Title"
  - "Role"
  - "Primary buying situation" 
  - "LinkedIn"
  - "Psychological stage" 
  - "intent signals" 
3. If you any reason that the account organization wouldn't benefit from a relationship with Fleet, change the "Type" to "Distraction" stop here. If you haven't disqualified the account at this point, update the "Marketing stage" to "Research-ready". 
After an account is marked "[Research-ready](https://fleetdm.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Report/00OUG000001LerV2AS/view?queryScope=userFolders)".

1. Research missing contacts and add them to salesforce if they are real by using the [ABM maneuvers spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ijtBKTjPg_AodnKEZY0ivia70ttDR3VMURT8rpYwYiw/edit?gid=0#gid=0) to generate a Sales Nav search. Make sure they have "role", "buying situation", "linkedinUrl", "psychological stage", "intent signals" completely filled out and correct.
2. For "Contact source" for any new contacts, use "Manual research".
3. Rank the account in terms of closability and fit based on what we see from it and its contacts. Mark any account that is not a fit as "Distraction" instead of "Prospect".
4. Research and discover mutual connections between fleeties and Mac admin community members within those contacts to help determine fit.
5. Check Snitcher activity for the account and the psystages of its contacts in Salesforce.
6. Update the "marketing stage" AND "type" accordingly (qualify or disqualify based on whether the contacts look good). Start running ABM ads on the account if moving it to "Ads running" for a total of 60 days otherwise, stop them if moving it out of "Ads running".


### Promote a post on LinkedIn

1. Create a classic campaign under ["Experiments"](https://www.linkedin.com/campaignmanager/accounts/509911695/campaigns?campaignGroupIds=%5B678398233%5D) following the YYYY-MM-DD.buying-situation - ad description with a goal of website visits or engagement to run for two weeks.
2. Choose the appropriate audience according to the buying situation and disable audience expansion and the LinkedIn audience network. 
3. When creating the ad for the new campaign, select "browse existing content" and find the post under the employee tab.
4. Launch campaign once approved.


### Settle content strategy

The Head of Marketing is the DRI for deploying Fleet's outward-facing content. The content schedule is settled significantly in advance to provide ample time for strategy and planning. Use the following steps to settle content strategy:

1. Using the [content calendar](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Hso0LxqwrRVINCyW_n436bNHmoqhoLhC8bcbvLPOs9A/edit?gid=809357993#gid=809357993), propose the content that Fleet will produce in the current quarter, and the strategy behind that content, including:
  - Release date: The date by which the content will be complete and finalized.
  - DRI: Person(s) responsible for the project management of this content.
  - Title (e.g. "Article: Fleet takes bacon to new heights with flying pigs release").
2. Attend a 30m meeting with Fleet's Client Platform Engineer & Community Advocate, CTO, and CEO to review and settle the proposed content.


### Settle event strategy

 Fleet's [Head of Marketing](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/demand#team) is the DRI for executing Fleet events efficiently, on-brand, and on-strategy within Fleet's event budget. Events are settled significantly in advance to provide ample time for strategy and planning.  

1. Using the [event strategy workbook](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YQXAX2Q_WnGkAwMYjMbQpV3nbCj7gOBbv7Y0u4twxzQ/edit#gid=1411322737), propose the events that Fleet will attend in the next 6 months, and the strategy for those events, including:
  - target buying situation of the audience
  - who from Fleet will attend
  - the training plan for Fleet attendees
  - which talk proposal Fleet will submit
  - all event materials, including printouts, banners, swag given out, and even the clothing worn by fleeties
  - estimated budget, including sponsorship or airfare, and lodging for attendees
2. Set up and attend a 30m meeting with the Fleet's Client Platform Engineer & Community Advocate and CEO:
  - First during this meeting, the Head of Marketing proposes an event issue for each of the **_current quarter's_** events to get input and any new information or changes from Fleet's Client Platform Engineer & Community Advocate and CEO. (Events for the current quarter were already decided in a previous event strategy session, so Fleet does not make changes except in extreme circumstances.)
  - Next, decide which events in the **_following quarter_** the company will invest time or money into.  This includes any event that Fleet pays to send someone to or to sponsor, and even events where Fleet's only involvement is that a fleetie will be giving a talk or otherwise representing the brand.
  - Finally, qualify or disqualify any newly-entered event ideas by either verifying and setting the buying situation, or removing the event idea from the spreadsheet.


### Book an event

Fleet's Head of Marketing is responsible for booking events that Fleet has chosen to attend and/or sponsor. To book an event, complete the steps in each event issue. Contact the [🫧 Head of Marketing](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/demand#team) as needed with any questions or blockers to booking an event.

> Note: The Demand department [settles all event strategy](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/demand#settle-event-strategy) prior to booking an event.

### Optimize ads through experimentation

Fleet improves click-through rates in their campaigns to make the most of their advertising budget and attract more engaged users, boosting product adoption and community participation.

Here's how:
1. Remove all but the top 5 performing ads in [each LinkedIn campaign in the "Evergreen awareness" campaign group](https://www.linkedin.com/campaignmanager/accounts/509911695/campaigns?campaignGroupIds=%5B678329963%5D).
2. Replace the ad in [each Linkedin campaign in the "ABM maneuvers" campaign group](https://www.linkedin.com/campaignmanager/accounts/509911695/campaigns?campaignGroupIds=%5B633848103%5D) so that it matches the top performer.

<!-- TODO: either delete this or expand

2. Look for an order status of "Draft" and click that order.
3. Copy the address displayed in the draft order. Close the modal.
4. Under "Order list", there's a search box for customers that you will need to paste the address.
5. The results should only display one order. Any additional could be duplicate orders or those made in error.
6. Repeat this process until all remaining draft orders show "Waiting for Fulfillment"


### Request swag
There are many times in which community members, customers, and contributors are in need of some cool Fleet swag. To request swag:
1. [Create an issue](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/g-demand-64e6c8e2d35c7f001a457b7f/issues/gh/fleetdm/confidential/new?issueType=issue) on the #g-demand board.

3. Decide if you'd like to include a personalized message and attach it to the issue.

### Fulfill a swag request

Swag requests are received in the form of issues and will be fulfilled based on availability. To process a swag request:
1. Check and communicate availability to the requestor.
2. Use the appropriate shipping method that best serves the company.
3. Attach tracking number to the issue and tag the requestor.
4. Confirm delivery and close issue.


### Send swag for community contributions to Fleet

### Run a new ad or change an existing ad

Any changes to the current running ads visible to a user, including designs, keywords, or targeting, are approved in 🦢🗣 Design review (#g-digital-experience), which [occurs regularly](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/product-groups#design-reviews) and is open to all fleeties.
1. [Digital Marketing Manager](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/demand#team) adds a discussion item about the change to the [website design review agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q73ublh9bcIL01JsY--gpZRd3KPT_KCX-F0RaorKJcM/edit)
2. During the call, they compare existing ads against the planned updates within the corresponding ad platform. ([Google Ads](https://ads.google.com/home/), [LinkedIn Campaign Manager](https://www.linkedin.com/campaignmanager/), etc.)
3. [Digital Marketing Manager](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/demand#team) makes changes and creates a calendar reminder to check performance either two weeks or four weeks from the date changes were made.

> **Do changes to keywords or targeting require a design review?** Currently, all changes to these things require discussion with our product marketer.
