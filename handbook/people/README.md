## Responsibilities

The People department is directly responsible for Fleet's culture, human resources, benefits, opening positions, compensation planning, onboarding, offboarding, remote work, the handbook, issue templates, Docusign templates, key spreadsheets, and project management tools. For Executive Assistant responsibilities, see the [🔭 CEO](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/ceo#responsibilities) page. 

> Commission planning, taxes, state unemployment insurance filings, business insurance, Delaware registered agent and franchise taxes, virtual mailbox, company phone number, and other adjacent areas of responsibility are run by [the Finance department](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/finance).


### Approve a new position

When review is requested on a proposal to open a new position, the Head of People will complete the following steps when reviewing the pull request:
1. In “Fleeties,” confirm the new row has manager, job title, department, COGS/OPEX, and CAC-inclusion filled in, that there are no broken formulas or formatting, and the start date is the first Monday of next month.
2. Confirm the job description consists only of changes to "Responsibilities" and "Experience," with an appropriate filename, and that the content looks accurate, is grammatically correct, and is otherwise ready to post in a public job description on fleetdm.com.
3. Ballpark and document compensation research for the role based on location, level, and company stage. 
   - _Add screenshot:_ Scroll to the very bottom of ["¶¶ 💌 Compensation decisions (offer math)"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NQ-IjcOTbyFluCWqsFLMfP4SvnopoXDcX0civ-STS5c/edit#heading=h.slomq4whmyas) and add a new heading for the role, pattern-matching off of the names of other nearby role headings. Then create written documentation of your research for future reference.  The easiest way to do this is to take screenshots of the [relevant benchmarks in Pave](https://pave.com) and paste those screenshots under the new heading.
4. Decide whether to approve this role or to consider it a different time.  If approving, then:
   - _Update financial model:_ Send the CFO a link to the position in ["¶¶ 💌 Compensation decisions (offer math)"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NQ-IjcOTbyFluCWqsFLMfP4SvnopoXDcX0civ-STS5c/edit#heading=h.slomq4whmyas) and request approval for the spend. Once approved, the CFO will add the new position to the financial model. 
   - _Update team database:_ Update the row in ["¶¶ 🥧 Equity plan"](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_GJlqnWWIQBiZFOoyl9YbTr72bg5qdSSp4O3kuKm1Jc/edit#gid=0) using the benchmarked compensation and share count.
     - _Salary:_ Enter the salary: If the role has variable compensation, use the role's OTE (on-target earning estimate) as the budgeted salary amount, and leave a note in the "Notes (¶¶)" cell clarifying the role's bonus or commission structure.
     - _Equity:_ Enter the equity as a number of shares, watching the percentage that is automatically calculated in the next cell.  Keep guessing different numbers of shares until you get the derived percentage looking like what you want to see.
   - _Create Slack channel:_ Create a private "#YYYY-hiring-xxxxxx" Slack channel (where "xxxxxx" is the job title and YYYY is the current year) for discussion and invite the hiring manager and Interim Head of People.
   - _Publish opening:_ Approve and merge the pull request.  The job posting will go live within ≤10 minutes.
   - _Track as approved in "Fleeties":_ In the "Fleeties" spreadsheet, find the row for the new position and update the "Job description" column and replace the URL of the pull request that originally proposed this new position with the URL of the GitHub merge commit when that PR was merged.
   - _Reply to requestor:_ Post a comment on the pull request, being sure to include a direct link to their live job description on fleetdm.com.  (This is the URL where candidates can go to read about the job and apply.  For example: `fleetdm.com/handbook/company/product-designer`):
     ```
     The new opening is now live!  Candidates can apply at fleetdm.com/handbook/company/railway-conductor.
     ```

> _Most columns of the "Equity plan" are updated automatically when "Fleeties" is, based on the unique identifier of each row, like `🧑‍🚀890`.  (Advisors have their own flavor of unique IDs, such as `🦉755`, which are defined in ["Advisors and investors"](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15knBE2-PrQ1Ad-QcIk0mxCN-xFsATKK9hcifqrm0qFQ/edit).)_
   

### Inform managers about hours worked

Every Friday, we collect hours worked for all hourly core team members and US-based consultants at Fleet. International consultants are reviewed monthly, when they submit their invoice. Consultants submit their hours through Gusto (US consultants) or Remote (international consultants) for DRI (generally their manager) review.
Here's how:
1. Find the DRI using the [People KPIs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Hso0LxqwrRVINCyW_n436bNHmoqhoLhC8bcbvLPOs9A/edit#gid=0).
2. Get DRI approval for hours worked
   -  **For hourly core team members and US consultants:**  
   Copy the template in the consultants column of the KPIs and send the teammate's DRI a direct message in Slack with an FYI including the total hours logged since last Saturday at midnight.
   - **For international consultants:**  
   When they submit their monthly invoice (which already includes a breakdown of total hours worked), download the invoice from Remote and route to the DRI for approval. 
3. The following Monday, check for updates to logged hours and ensure the KPI sheet aligns with HRIS records. If there are discrepancies between what was previously reported, reconfirm logged hours with the teammate's DRI and update the KPI sheet to reflect the correct amount.


### Prepare for the All hands

- **Every month** the Head of People will do the prep work for the monthly "✌️ All hands 🖐👋🤲👏🙌🤘" call.
  -  In the ["👋 All hands" folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cw_lL3_Xu9ZOXKGPghh8F4tc0ND9kQeY?usp=sharing), create a new folder using "yyyy-mm - All hands".
  - Update "End of the quarter" slides to reflect the current countdown.
  - Download a copy of the previous month's keynote file and rename the copy pattern matching existing files.
  - Update the slides to reflect the current "All hands" date (e.g. cover slides month and the "You are here" slide)'
  - Update slides that contain metrics to reflect current information using the [📈 KPIs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Hso0LxqwrRVINCyW_n436bNHmoqhoLhC8bcbvLPOs9A/edit#gid=0) doc.
  - Update the "Spotlight slide" for guest speakers.
  - Add new customer logos from Mike's bookmarks ["Customers list"](https://fleetdm.lightning.force.com/lightning/o/Account/list?filterName=00B4x00000CTHP8EAP) and Google "Company name" to find the current logo.

- **First "All hands" of the quarter**
  - Audit the "Strategy" slide.
  - Audit the "Goals" slide

The day before the All hands, the Head of People and the CEO will review and prepare slides that reflect the CEO's vision and focus. 


### Share recording of all hands meeting

The Executive Assistant will post a link to the All hands Gong recording and slide deck in Slack.

4. Schedule the Slack message to go out at 6pm CT (18:00).


### Update personnel details

When a Fleetie, consultant or advisor requests an update to their personnel details (name, location, phone, etc), follow these steps to ensure accurate representation across systems.
1. Team member submits a [💼 Teammate relocation](https://github.com/fleetdm/confidential/issues/new?assignees=&labels=%3Ahelp-people&projects=&template=x-teammate-relocation.md) to update their personnel details (or People team creates if the request comes via email or is sensitive and needs a classified issue).
    - If change is for a primary identification or contact method, ask for evidence of change and capture in [employee's personnel file](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UL7o3BzkTKnpvIS4hm_RtbOilSABo3oG?usp=drive_link).
2. People makes change to HRIS (Gusto or Remote) to reflect change. 
    - Note: if making the change requires follow-up steps, resolve those steps to action the change.
3. Once change is effected in HRIS, People makes changes to ["🧑‍🚀 Fleeties"](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OSLn-ZCbGSjPusHPiR5dwQhheH1K8-xqyZdsOe9y7qc/edit#gid=0) spreadsheet.
4. If required, People makes any relevant changes to [Fleet's equity plan](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_GJlqnWWIQBiZFOoyl9YbTr72bg5qdSSp4O3kuKm1Jc/edit#gid=0).
5. If required, People makes any relevant changes to the ["🗺️ Geographical factors"](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rCVCs-eOo-VSEG7fPLgdq5l7oSaActl5bewaWP7PnSE/edit#gid=1533353559) spreadsheet and follows through on any action items involving tax implications (i.e. registering with a new state for employer taxes).
6. If required, People also makes changes to other core systems (e.g., creating a new email alias in Google Workspace, updating details in Carta, etc.).
7. The change is now actioned, notify the team member and close the issue.

> Note: if the Fleetie is US based and has a qualifying life event that impacts benefit coverage, they can [follow the Gusto steps](https://support.gusto.com/article/100895878100000/Change-your-benefits-with-a-qualifying-life-event) to update their coverage elections.


### Change a Fleetie's role

When People receives [notification of a Fleetie's role changing](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/leadership#request-a-role-change-for-a-fleetie), The Head of People will bring the proposed title change to the next Roundup meeting with the CEO for approval. If the proposed change is rejected, the Head of People will inform the requesting manager as to why. If approved, use the following steps to change a Fleetie's role:  
1. Update ["🧑‍🚀 Fleeties"](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OSLn-ZCbGSjPusHPiR5dwQhheH1K8-xqyZdsOe9y7qc/edit#gid=0):
    - Search the spreadsheet for the Fleetie in need of a job title change.
    - Input the new job title in the Fleetie's row in the "Job title" cell.
    - Navigate to the "Org chart" tab of the spreadsheet, and verify that the Fleetie's title appears correctly in the org chart.
2. Update the departmental handbook page with the change of job title
3. [Prepare salary benchmarking information](#prepare-salary-benchmarking-information) to determine whether the teammate's current compensation aligns with the benchmarks of the new role.
   -  If the benchmark is significantly different, take the steps to [update a team member's compensation](#prepare-salary-benchmarking-information).
4. Update the relevant payroll/HRIS system.
    - For updating Gusto (US-based Fleeties):
      - Log in to Gusto and navigate to "People > Team members".
      - Find the Fleetie and select them to see their profile page.
      - Under the "Compensation" heading, select edit and update the "Job title" and input the specific date the change happened. Save the changes.
    - For updating Remote (non-US Fleeties):
      - Log in to Remote and navigate to "Requests".
      - Click "New Request" and select the employee from the dropdown box. Then, select "Employee Agreement Amendement". 
      - Follow Remote's prompts to complete the amendement. 
      - Take any relevant follow-up steps as directed by Remote in order to make the required changes to the Fleetie's profile. 


### Change a Fleetie's manager

When People receives notification of a Fleetie's manager changing, follow these steps to ensure correct recording in our systems.
1. Update [🧑‍🚀 Fleeties](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OSLn-ZCbGSjPusHPiR5dwQhheH1K8-xqyZdsOe9y7qc/edit#gid=0):
    - Search for the Fleetie's new manager, and copy the new manager's unique ID from the far left "Unique ID" column.
    - Search for the Fleetie whose manager is changing, and paste (without formatting) their new manager's unique ID in the "Reports to: (manager unique ID)" cell in the Fleetie's row.
    - Verify that the "Reports to (auto: manager name and job title)" cell in the Fleetie's row reflects the new manager's details.
    - Verify that in the new manager's row, the "# direct reports" cell reflect the correct number.
    - Navigate to the "Org chart" tab in the spreadsheet, and verify that the Fleetie now appears in the correct place in the org chart.
2. If the person's department is changing, then update both departmental handbook pages to move the person to their new department:
    - Remove the person from the "Team" section of the old department and add them to the "Team" section of the new department.
3. If the person's level of confidential access will change along with the change to their manager, then update that level of access:
    - Update Google Workspace to make sure this person lives in the correct Google Group, removing them from the old and/or adding them to the new.
    - Update 1Password to remove this person from old vaults and/or add them to new vaults.
    - For a team member moving from "classified" to "confidential" access, check Gusto, Remote, and other systems to remove their access.

> **Note:** The Fleeties spreadsheet is the source of truth for who everyone's manager is and their job titles.


### Run payroll

Many of these processes are automated, but it's vital to check Gusto and Remote manually for accuracy. 

 - Salaried fleeties are automated in Gusto and Remote.
 - Hourly fleeties and consultants are a manual process each month in Gusto and Remote.

| Payroll type                 | What to use                  | DRI                          |
|:-----------------------------|:-----------------------------|:-----------------------------|
| [Commissions and ramp](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/finance#run-us-commission-payroll)         | "Off-cycle - Commission" payroll          | Finance
| Sign-on bonus                | "Bonus" payroll              | Finance
| Performance bonus            | "Bonus" payroll              | Finance    
| Accelerations (quarterly)    | "Off-cycle - Commission" payroll          | Finance
| [US contractor payroll](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/people#run-payroll) | "Off-cycle" payroll | People

To complete payroll for a salaried US employee, use the following steps:
1. Log in to your admin [Gusto](https://app.gusto.com/login) account.
2. Navigate to Pay > Run payroll > Run payroll.
3. Navigate to the People board, and search for "welcoming" issues or "offboarding" issues.
4. Ensure that new hires during the payroll period have accurate hours and salary rates reflected (compare with the equity plan), and that offboarded employees' final hours are correctly recorded and their final payroll processed.
5. Check for any workiversary compensation changes for the month and ensure they're correctly reflected in both Gusto and the equity plan. 
6. Once the above is verified correct, ensure payment is via direct deposit and select "Review summary".
7. Ensure the payroll date is the last business day of the month, and hit submit.

To complete payroll for a salaried international employee, use the following steps:
1. Log in to your admin [Remote](https://employ.remote.com) account. 
   - While Fleet considers all Fleeties employees, Remote differentiates between employees (that Fleet employs directly) and International contractors (that Fleet employs via a contracted company).
2. Verify the number of employees in each country by checking the "Stats" tab in the [Fleeties doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OSLn-ZCbGSjPusHPiR5dwQhheH1K8-xqyZdsOe9y7qc/edit?gid=1874060596#gid=1874060596). If the numbers seem incorrect, cross-reference with the main Fleeties tab to ensure all employees are accounted for in Remote.
3. Verify that all teammates have a planned (or already processed) payroll.
   - To check payroll for those Remote considers "employees", go to Payroll > Payroll runs 
      - Verify that any employees getting paid more frequently than monthly have had their payments processed throughout the month (Canada only currently).
      - Navigate to the People board, and search for "welcoming" issues or "offboarding" issues.
      - Ensure that new hires during the payroll period have accurate hours and salary rates reflected (compare with the equity plan), and that offboarded employees' final hours are correctly recorded and their final payroll processed.
      - Check for any workiversary compensation changes for the month and ensure they're correctly reflected in both Remote and the equity plan.
      - If anything is incorrect, open a ticket using the "Requests" feature. 
   - To check payroll for those Remote considers "contractors", go to Contractor payments > Schedules.
      - Ensure all teammates have a pending or completed payment (except those that invoice for payment).
      - Navigate to the People board, and search for "welcoming" issues or "offboarding" issues
      - Ensure that new hires during the payroll period have accurate hours and salary rates reflected (compare with the equity plan), and that offboarded employees' final hours are correctly recorded and their final payroll processed.
      - Check for any workiversary compensation changes for the month and ensure they're correctly reflected in both Remote and the equity plan.
      - If anything is incorrect, open a ticket using the "Requests" feature. 
      - If all payments are scheduled or processing and are correct, no action needed. This payroll will process successfully without intervention.
    
To complete payroll for a US contractor, use the following steps:
1. Log in to your admin [Gusto](https://app.gusto.com/login) account.
2. Navigate to Time & Attendance > Time tracking > Review & Sync. 
3. Click "Sync hours to payments" and confirm that the dates reflect the period from the 27th of the previous month to the 26th of the current month.
4. Cross-check total hours for contractors in Gusto to the total hours in the [KPI spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Hso0LxqwrRVINCyW_n436bNHmoqhoLhC8bcbvLPOs9A/edit?gid=0#gid=0) to ensure they're correct. Since the KPI spreadsheet tracks hours weekly, ensure any discrepancies are validated.
5. Once all entries have been validated, click Sync and lock timesheets > Continue.
6. Validate payment amounts are correct, then submit payments.

To complete payroll for an international contractor, use the following steps:
1. Contractors in Remote will submit invoices for payment at the end of the month.
2. When the contractor submits the invoice for payment, follow the [Inform managers about hours worked](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/people#inform-managers-about-hours-worked) process for international contractors.
3. Once hours have been confirmed, log in to [Remote](https://employ.remote.com) and navigate to "Invoices" to approve and pay the invoice. 


### Prepare salary benchmarking information

1. Use the relevant template text in the README section of the [¶¶ 💌 Compensation decisions document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NQ-IjcOTbyFluCWqsFLMfP4SvnopoXDcX0civ-STS5c/edit?usp=sharing) for a current Fleetie, a new role, a prospective hire, or other benchmarking use case.
2. Copy the template text and paste at the end of the document.
3. Fill in details as required, pulling from [🧑‍🚀 Fleeties spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OSLn-ZCbGSjPusHPiR5dwQhheH1K8-xqyZdsOe9y7qc/edit#gid=0) and [equity spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_GJlqnWWIQBiZFOoyl9YbTr72bg5qdSSp4O3kuKm1Jc/edit?usp=sharing) as required.
4. Use the teammate's information to benchmark in [Pave](https://www.pave.com/) (login details in 1Password). You can pattern match from previous benchmarking entries and include all company assumptions. Add the direct link to the Pave benchmark.


### Recognize employee workiversaries

At Fleet, everyone is recognized on their [workiversary](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/communications#workiversaries). To ensure this happens, take the following steps:

1. On the 1st of every month, use [Fleeties (private google doc)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OSLn-ZCbGSjPusHPiR5dwQhheH1K8-xqyZdsOe9y7qc/edit#gid=0) to determine who is celebrating their workiversary in the next month.
2. List all team members in the ["✌️ All hands 🖐👋🤲👏🙌🤘" section of the e-group doc (confidential Google Doc)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13fjq3T0bZGOUah9cqHVxngckv0EB2R24A3gfl5cH7eo/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.gg4j9w7jg6g3) using the following format: `[workiversary date (DD-MMM)] - [teammate name] - [number of years at Fleet]`.
3. On the day prior to a workiversary, send the teammate’s manager a DM on Slack:


    ```
    Hey! Just a heads up, tomorrow is [teammate’s name] [number of years at Fleet] workiversary at Fleet.
    People can post something in the #random channel to recognize them, would you like to make that post instead?
    ```
 
   > If a manager elects to post and hasn't done so by 2pm ET on the day of the workiversary, send them a friendly reminder and offer to post instead.

4. If the manager has deferred to People, schedule a Slack post for the following day to recognize the teammate's contributions at Fleet. If you’re unsure about what to post, take a look at what’s been [posted previously](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Va4TYAs9Tb0soDQPeoeMr-qHxk0Xrlf-DUlBe4jn29Q/edit).


### Update a team member's compensation

To [change a teammate's compensation](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/communications#compensation-changes), follow these steps:
1. Create a copy of the ["Values assessment" template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1P5TyRV2v-YN0aR_X8vd8GksKcr3uHfUDdshqpVzamV8/edit?usp=drive_link) and move it to the teammate's [personnel folder in Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UL7o3BzkTKnpvIS4hm_RtbOilSABo3oG?usp=drive_link).
2. Share the values assessment document with the manager via Slack DM (include the Head of People) and ask the manager to fill out the values assessment.
3. Once the values assessment is complete, [prepare salary benchmarking information](#prepare-salary-benchmarking-information) and at-mention the Head of People in the workiversary issue. Add a "DISCUSS" item to the roundup doc so the compensation change can be reviewed with the CEO.
4. Once compensation decisions have been finalized, the Head of People will send the teammate's manager a Slack DM to communicate the compensation decision and asking them to inform the teammate.
5. Update the respective payroll platform (Gusto or Remote): 
   - In Gusto, navigate to the personnel page, selecting salary field, and updating with an effective date that makes the next payroll.
   - In Remote, navigate to "Requests", start a new request, select the employee from the dropdown box, and begin the process for an employee agreement amendement. 
7. Update the [equity spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_GJlqnWWIQBiZFOoyl9YbTr72bg5qdSSp4O3kuKm1Jc/edit?usp=sharing) (internal doc) by adding to the "Notes" cell.
  - Update the "¶¶ Annual OTE ($)" column with the new compensation information.
  - Update the "Last compensation change" column with the effective date from payroll platform.
  - Update the "¶¶ Notes" column. **⚠️ MAKE SURE NOT TO DELETE ANY EXISTING NOTES ⚠️** Add the note to the top of the cell using the following format: `As of YYYY-MM-DD OTE +15k` (pattern match off of other 2024 notes). Link your note to the relevant title in the ["¶¶ 💌 Compensation decisions (offer math)" (classified Google Doc)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NQ-IjcOTbyFluCWqsFLMfP4SvnopoXDcX0civ-STS5c/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.slomq4whmyas).
  - If the company decides on an additional equity grant as part of a compensation change, note the previous equity and new situation in detail in the "Notes" column of the equity plan. Update the "Grant started?" column to "todo" which adds it to the queue for the next time grants are processed (quarterly).
7. Calculate the monthly burn rate increase percentage and notify the CEO via a Slack DM.


### Change the DRI of a consultant

1. In the [KPIs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Hso0LxqwrRVINCyW_n436bNHmoqhoLhC8bcbvLPOs9A/edit#gid=0) sheet, find the consultant's column.
2. Change the DRI documented there to the new DRI who will receive information about the consultant's hours.


### Add an advisor

First: Advisor agreements are sent through [DocuSign](https://www.docusign.com/), using the "Advisor Agreement" template.
- Update the ["Advisors" sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15knBE2-PrQ1Ad-QcIk0mxCN-xFsATKK9hcifqrm0qFQ/edit#gid=1803674483)
  >*Be sure to mark any columns that haven't been completed yet as "TODO"*
- Update the "Equity plan" sheet (which should have been automatically updated after updating "Advisors" thanks to the global unique IDs next to each row which are used to connect the spreadsheets) to reflect the default number of shares for advisor equity grants.
- Send the advisor agreement [through Docusign](https://apps.docusign.com/send/templates?view=shared&folder=0482b0fd-a752-41be-93a0-185e2fb7ef54) using the CEO's account, pulling the advisor's email address from a recent calendar event on the CEO's calendar.
- Complete the first step of signing, which involves filling in the number of shares.
- Then wait for the advisor to sign. (Fleet's CEO will sign after that)

Then, to finalize a new advisor after signing is complete:
- Schedule quarterly recurring 1h meeting between the CEO and the advisor, with 30m of recurring prep scheduled back to back ahead of the meeting.
- Update the status columns in the ["Advisors" sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15knBE2-PrQ1Ad-QcIk0mxCN-xFsATKK9hcifqrm0qFQ/edit#gid=1803674483) to show that the agreement has been signed, and ask the new advisor to add us on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/71111416), [Crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/fleet-device-management), and [Angellist](https://angel.co/company/fleetdm).

### Convert a Fleetie to a consultant

If a Fleetie decides they want to move to being a [consultant](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/leadership#consultants), either the Fleetie or their manager need to create a [custom issue for the People team](https://github.com/fleetdm/confidential/issues/new?assignees=&labels=%3Ahelp-people&projects=&template=1-custom-request.md&title=Request%3A+_______________________) to notify them of the change.
Once notified, People takes the following steps:
1. Confirm the following details with the Fleetie:
    - Date of change
    - Term of consultancy (time period)
    - Hours/capacity expected (hours per week or month)
    - Confirm hourly rate
2. Once details are confirmed, use the information given to create the consulting agreement for the Fleetie (either in docusign (US-based) or via Plane (international)), and send to their personal email for signature. Once signed, save in Fleetie's [employee file](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UL7o3BzkTKnpvIS4hm_RtbOilSABo3oG?usp=drive_link).
3. Schedule the Fleetie's final day in HRIS (Gusto or Remote).
4. Update final day in ["🧑‍🚀 Fleeties"](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OSLn-ZCbGSjPusHPiR5dwQhheH1K8-xqyZdsOe9y7qc/edit#gid=0) spreadsheet.
5. Create an [offboarding issue](https://github.com/fleetdm/classified/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/%F0%9F%9A%AA-offboarding-____________.md) for the Fleetie converting to a consultant, and confirm with their manager if there is a need to retain any tools or access while they are a consultant (default to removing all access from Fleet email, and migrating to personal email for Slack and other tools unless there is a business case to retain the Fleet email and associated tool access).
6. Follow the offboarding issue for next steps, including communicating to teammates and updating equity plan.


### Retire a KPI

The ["🗓️ KPIs" (confidential)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Hso0LxqwrRVINCyW_n436bNHmoqhoLhC8bcbvLPOs9A/edit?gid=0#gid=0) sheet feeds data into the ["🪴🌧️🦉 Investor updates" (confidential)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10T7Q9iuHA4vpfV7qZCm6oMd5U1bLftBSobYD0RR8RkM/edit?gid=0#gid=0) sheet. Because of this linkage, retiring a KPI requires updating both sheets to avoid broken references or incorrect reporting. To retire a KPI, the Head of People will:
1. Move the KPI to the retired section of the "🗓️ KPIs" sheet.
2. Validate that each column in "🪴🌧️🦉 Investor updates" still reflects the correct data.
3. If retiring the KPI caused column positions to change:
   - Locate the new column position in the "🗓️ KPIs"
   - Update the relevant cell in row 2 of the "🪴🌧️🦉 Investor updates" with the new column location
4. Scan "🪴🌧️🦉 Investor updates" to confirm all metrics are populating as expected and no data is missing or misaligned.

### Review Fleet's US company benefits

Annually, around mid-year, Fleet will be prompted by Gusto to review company benefits. The goal is to keep changes minimal. Follow these steps:
1. Log in to your [Gusto admin account](https://gusto.com/).
2. Navigate to "Benefits" and select "Renewal survey".
3. Complete the survey questions, aiming for minimal changes.
4. Approximately 2-3 months after survery completion, Gusto will suggest plans based on Fleet's responses. Choose plans with minimal changes.
5. Gusto will offer these plans to employees during open enrollment, with new coverage starting 3-4 weeks afterward.


### Purchase a SaaS tool

When procuring SaaS tools and services, analyze the purchase of these subscription services look for these way to help the company:
- Get product demos whenever possible.  Does the product do what it's supposed to do in the way that it is supposed to do it?
- Avoid extra features you don't need, and if they're there anyway, avoid using them.
- Data portability: is it possible for Fleet to export it's data if we stop using it? Is it easy to pull that data in an understandable format?
- Programmability: Does it have a publicly documented legible REST API that requires at most a single API token?
- Intentionality: The product fits into other tools and processes that Fleet uses today. Avoid [unintended consequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midas). The tool will change to fit the company, or we won't use it. 


### Downgrade an unused license seat

- On the first Wednesday of every quarter, the Head of People will audit license seats in Figma, Slack, GitHub, Salesforce and other tools.
- During this time, as many seats will be downgraded as possible. When doubt exists, downgrade.
- Afterward, post in #random letting folks know that the quarterly tool reconciliation and seat clearing is complete, and that any members who lost access to anything they still need can submit a GitHub issue to the People department to have their access restored.
- The goal is to build deep, integrated knowledge of tool usage across Fleet and cut costs whenever possible. It will also force conversations on redundancies and decisions that aren't helping the business that otherwise might not be looked at a second time.  


### Process a tool upgrade request from a team member

- A Fleetie may request an upgraded license seat for Fleet tools by submitting an issue through GitHub.
- The Head of People will upgrade or add the license seat as needed and let the requesting team member know they did it.


### Send the weekly update

Every Friday, e-group members [report their KPIs for the week](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Hso0LxqwrRVINCyW_n436bNHmoqhoLhC8bcbvLPOs9A/edit) by 5:00pm U.S. CT. Every Friday at 6PM, the Apprentice will post a short update in [#general](https://fleetdm.slack.com/archives/C019FNQPA23). To send the weekly update follow these steps:  
  
1. Navigate to the current weeks row in the [KPIs Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Hso0LxqwrRVINCyW_n436bNHmoqhoLhC8bcbvLPOs9A/edit#gid=0).
2. Check the KPI sheet at 5pm US central time to ensure all departments have updated their KPIs on time.  If any departments are delinquent, notify the department head and the Head of People.
3. Copy the entire formula in this weeks "Weekly update" update cell and paste without formating (CMD+⇧+V) back into the same cell. The formula will now look like this:
4. Paste the newly formatted message in the [#general Slack channel](https://fleetdm.slack.com/archives/C019FNQPA23) and delete the double quotes around the message and any links that unfurl from links in the weekly update message.
5. Use the drop-down next to the send button and select "Custom time" and schedule the message to send "Today" at 18:00 or 6pm CT.


### Cancel a vendor or subscription

Once the decision has been made not to renew a tool or subscription on Fleet's behalf, use the following steps to churn/cancel a vendor or subscription:

1. Cancel the subscription, including recurring billing. If invoiced, then send churn notice.
2. Update ["¶ 🧮 The numbers" spreadsheet (confidential doc)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1X-brkmUK7_Rgp7aq42drNcUg8ZipzEiS153uKZSabWc/edit?gid=2112277278#gid=2112277278).
  - Prepend the recurring expense title with "CANCELLED - ".
  - Zero-out "Projected monthly burn" and "Projected invoice amount".
3. Remove references from integrated systems and references (i.e. unplug the tool from any other integrations)
4. Remove any shared access from 1Password vaults.
5. Update any reference to the tool or subscription and afterwards communicate the change (e.g. by linking to your merged PR in Slack).
