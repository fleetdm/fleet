TODO: In order to keep continuity across CEO shadow participants. Always, cc (TODO: email group) on emails as part of the program. This makes sure that even after you've left the program, the response and follow-up can be tracked.

### Considerations for other companies starting CEO shadow programs
GitLab co-founder and CEO Sid Sijbrandij [answered questions in a YouTube livestream](https://youtu.be/ExG8_bnIAMI) from Sam Altman, as the two discussed considerations for implementing a CEO Shadow program in other organizations. Key takeaways are documented below.

 1. CEOs should not optimize meetings for Shadows. They  learn by being in the room, either in-person or virtual, and it's OK if the Shadow doesn't fully understand everything.
 2. A well-designed CEO Shadow program shouldn't burden a CEO; in fact, Shadows should actively make a CEO's day easier by assisting with notes and changing relevant portions of the company handbook upon request.
 3. Non-obvious benefits for a CEO (and their organization) include CEO empathy and humanizing a CEO, such that team members are more comfortable contributing input to an executive. Shadow alumni can translate real-world examples of [assuming positive intent](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#assume-positive-intent) from their time in the program to their direct reports, further fortifying company culture.
 4. Make certain that CEO Shadows do not plan to do any of their usual work. Shadows should prepare their team as if they were on vacation. Attempting to shadow the CEO while also maintaining a full workload creates undue stress for the CEO Shadow.

### Alumni 
TODO: (This is a chart with info on CEO alumni) (Create a slack channel for CEO-shadow-alumni)

## OKR planning

OKRs help to inform what to prioritize and communicate company goals while encouraging cross-team collaboration.

At the end of the quarter and key points throughout the quarter (every three weeks), we review the status of each OKR (depending on the KR, either 100% or ≥70% completion is considered "success")

- Review topdown and departmental OKRs as they are turned in.
- OKRs are finalized one week from when topdown OKRs were initially reviewed.
- Finalized OKRs are shared company-wide and at the "All hands" meeting and, at least to some degree, become public.
- Throughout the quarter, Mike and Zach have OKR preplanning meetings (every three weeks) to prepare OKRs for the upcoming quarter. 

## 1:1 Mike:Sid document preparation

Every two weeks, our CEO Mike has a 1:1 meeting with our Investor Sid. The Digital Experience Team completes four parts while constructing the associated document. 

 - After the 1:1 meeting has happened, Charlie makes a copy of the original document, labels it "yyyy-mm-dd Backup copy of Mike from Fleet & Sid," and moves it to a private folder. 
 - Charlie will change the permissions on the new copy to share it with Mike and Zach and set Mike to be the file's owner. If there are any agenda items labeled "TODO," Charlie will comment in the backup copy to assign them to Mike.
 - Charlie prepares the original document by deleting the agenda items in the "Hallway" and "Feedback" sections, leaving only the "Vision" section.
 - Charlie will update the monthly "All Hands" link and grant Sid viewing access. 
 - Charlie will send Mike links to the new document and the backup copy in a direct message in Slack. 
 - The day before the meeting, Charlie will prepare the "Vision" section of the original document. Charlie will collect and update information related to annual recurring revenue, new members in the `#fleet` channel in the osquery Slack, the number of new customers and opportunities from Salesforce, the total number of devices using Fleet, the company's current headcount, and banking information.

## Investor and advisor updates

We like to regularly share updates about how Fleet is growing with our investors and advisors. 
  - Charlie tracks the most recent updates with investors and advisors and coordinates emails, zoom calls, or the investor or advisor's preferred method of communication with @mikermcneil and preps materials as needed.

## Calendar audit

As Fleet grows, time management for the CEO is more essential. Charlie will audit the CEOs calendar and set meeting notes for calls with external attendees. In the notes document include:
- LinkedIn profile link of all outside participants
- Company profile link 
- Context that helps the CEO to understand purpose of meeting at a glance
- Share document with meeting participants

**Additional product design review sessions are welcomed and a top priority for the CEO to get on the calendar quickly.  Other internal meetings and blocked time can always be moved to make room.  External meetings, travel, and personal commitments cannot be moved.  To schedule, mention @Charlie Chance in the #meetings channel.**

## Gong

How to file videos from Gong recordings (**marking as "private" in gong is not appropriate. Never use it- instead, use this process**):
  1. Move to ¶¶ recording in google drive.
  2. Download video from Gong, then delete it from Gong (promptly) and instead upload mp4 to appropriate ¶¶ folder in google drive.
  3. Move generated transcript doc in google drive (promptly) instead into appropriate ¶¶ folder in google drive.
  4. **For both video and transcript**: Double-checked permissions to make sure they are only ¶¶ viewers.
  5. Include the links to ¶¶ video and transcript here in this doc:
    - If appropriate, make this doc "¶¶," plus fleeties who were on the call.
    - Include in the doc "link to video:"
    - Include in the doc "link to transcript:"

## Private whiteboard

From time to time the CEO will ask Charlie to unroll a Slack thread into a well-named whiteboard google doc for safekeeping and future searching. 
  1. Start with a new doc
  2. Name the file with "yyyy-mm-dd - topic" (something empathetic and easy to find)
  3. Use CMD+SHFT+V to paste the Slack convo into the doc
  4. Reapply formatting manually (be mindful of quotes, links, and images)
      - To copy images right-click+copy and then paste in the doc (some resizing may be necessary to fit the page)
