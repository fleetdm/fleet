# Security policies

## Information security policy and acceptable use policy

This Information Security Policy is intended to protect Fleet Device Management Inc's employees, contractors, partners, customers, and the company from illegal or damaging actions by individuals, either knowingly or unknowingly.

Internet/Intranet/Extranet-related systems, including but not limited to computer equipment, software, operating systems, storage media, network accounts providing electronic mail, web browsing, and file transfers, are the property of Fleet Device Management Inc. These systems are to be used for business purposes in serving the interests of the company, and of our clients and customers in the course of normal operations.

Effective security is a team effort involving the participation and support of every Fleet Device Management Inc employee or contractor who deals with information and/or information systems. It is the responsibility of every team member to read and understand this policy and conduct their activities accordingly.

Fleet requires all workforce members to comply with the following acceptable use requirements and procedures, such as:

1. The use of Fleet computing systems is subject to monitoring by Fleet IT and/or Security teams.

2. Fleet team members must not leave computing devices (including laptops and smart devices) used for business purposes, including company-provided and BYOD devices, unattended in public.

3. Device encryption must be enabled for all mobile devices accessing company data, such as whole-disk encryption for all laptops.

4. Use only legal software with a valid license installed through the internal "app store" or trusted sources. Well-documented open source software can be used. If in doubt, ask in *#g-security*.  

5. Avoid sharing credentials. Secrets must be stored safely, using features such as GitHub secrets. For accounts and other sensitive data that need to be shared, use the company-provided password manager.

6. At Fleet, we are public by default. Sensitive information from logs, screenshots, or other types of data (memory dumps, for example), must be sanitized to remove any sensitive or confidential information prior to posting.

7. Anti-malware or equivalent protection and monitoring must be installed and enabled on all endpoint systems that may be affected by malware, including workstations, laptops and servers.

8. It is strictly forbidden to download or store any secrets used to sign Orbit installer updates on end-user computing devices, including laptops, workstations, and mobile devices.

9. Only company-owned and managed computers are allowed to connect directly to Fleet autoupdater production environments.

10. Fleet team members must not let anyone else use Fleet-provided and managed workstations unsupervised, including family members and support personnel of vendors. Use screen sharing instead of allowing them to access your system directly.

11. Device's operating system must be kept up to date. Fleet-managed systems will receive prompts for updates to be installed, and BYOD devices are to be updated by the team member using it or they might lose access. 

12. Team members must not store sensitive data on portable storage.

13. The use of Fleet company accounts on "shared" computers, such as hotel kiosk systems, is strictly prohibited.

Fleet is committed to ensuring all workforce members participate in security and compliance in their roles at Fleet. We encourage self-management and reward the right behaviors. 

Fleet policy requires all workforce members to comply with the HR Security Policy.

Fleet policy requires that:

1. Background verification checks on candidates for employees and contractors with production access to the Fleet automatic updater service must be carried out in accordance with relevant laws, regulations, and ethics. These checks should be proportional to the business requirements, the classification of the information to be accessed, and the perceived risk.

2. Employees, contractors, and third-party users must agree to and sign the terms and conditions of their employment contract and comply with acceptable use.

3. Employees will perform an onboarding process that familiarizes them with the environments, systems, security requirements, and procedures that Fleet already has in place. Employees will also have ongoing security awareness training that is audited.

4. Employee offboarding will include reiterating any duties and responsibilities still valid after terminations, verifying that access to any Fleet systems has been removed, and ensuring that all company-owned assets are returned.

5. Fleet and its employees will take reasonable measures to ensure no sensitive data is transmitted via digital communications such as email or posted on social media outlets.

6. Fleet will maintain a list of prohibited activities that will be part of onboarding procedures and have training available if/when the list of those activities changes.

7. A fair disciplinary process will be used for employees suspected of committing breaches of security. Fleet will consider multiple factors when deciding the response, such as whether or not this was a first offense, training, business contracts, etc. Fleet reserves the right to terminate employees in the case of severe cases of misconduct.

8. Fleet will maintain a reporting structure that aligns with the organization's business lines and/or individual's functional roles. The list of employees and reporting structure must be available to [all employees](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OSLn-ZCbGSjPusHPiR5dwQhheH1K8-xqyZdsOe9y7qc/edit#gid=0).

9. Employees will receive regular feedback and acknowledgment from their managers and peers. Managers will give constant feedback on performance, including but not limited to during regular one-on-one meetings.

10. Fleet will publish job descriptions for available positions and conduct interviews to assess a candidate's technical skills as well as soft skills prior to hiring.

11. Background checks of an employee or contractor must be performed by operations and/or the hiring team prior to the start date of employment.
