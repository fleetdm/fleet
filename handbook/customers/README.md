## Sales
The Fleet Customer team embodies [our values](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company#values) in every aspect of our work. We prioritize efficiency in our processes and operations. We succeed because of transparent, cross-functional collaboration. We are committed to hiring for and celebrating diversity, and we strive to create an environment of inclusiveness and belonging for all. We embrace a spirit of iteration, understanding that we can always improve.

Fleet's main source for prospects to learn about the company and its offerings is our website, fleetdm.com. There are many places across the website for prospects to ask for more information, request merchandise, try the product and even purchase licenses directly. If the user experience in any of these locations asks for an email address or other contact information, Fleet may use that contact information for follow-up, including sales and marketing purposes. That contact information is for Fleet's sole use, and we do not give or sell that information to any third parties.


## Customer codenames
Occasionally, we will need to track public issues for customers that wish to remain anonymous on our public issue tracker. To do this, we choose an appropriate minor planet name from this [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_named_minor_planets_(alphabetical)) and create a label which we attach to the issue and any future issues for this customer.


## Outreach 
At Fleet we use Outreach for sending emails to community members based on triggers or as part of campaigns. To get access to Outreach ask for a license in `#g-business-operations` [Internal video](https://www.loom.com/share/16bdb5dce92649f79aecb89112d95745)(Internal doc). We also use LinkedIn to connect and communicate with community members, prospects and customers. The CEO is DRI for all outbound messaging efforts with the CRO as backup. Fleeties please confer with the CRO before engaging in any outbound messaging.

### Outreach one-pager
Our one-pager offers a summary of what Fleet does. It can help stakeholders become familiar with the company and product while also being a useful tool the Growth team uses for sales outreach.

#### Flow of communication in the event of an emergency (P0) request
![Screen Shot 2022-12-05 at 10 22 43 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114112018/205676145-38491aa2-288d-4a6c-a611-a96b5a87a0f0.png)


## Customer support workflow for Slack + Zendesk
This section outlines both the automated workflows and manual triggers associated with Fleet's Slack integration to Zendesk. The purpose of this integration is to:
- Provide Fleet with better service level agreement (SLA) tracking on requests (especially those submitted outside of business hours)
- Better track threads for issues that require advanced troubleshooting
- Consolidate support requests into a single-source, searchable system for faster issue resolution in the future 

There are three different situations when a customer support request could result in a ticket being created in Zendesk. They are as follows: 
1. When a request has been submitted outside of business hours via Slack automation
2. When a Fleet staff member has flagged an issue that requires advanced troubleshooting and determines that they want to move it into Zendesk for management 
3. When any Fleet user submits a support request via email

### Workflow when a request is submitted outside of business hours:
1. A new message is posted in any Slack channel
2. (Zapier filter) The automation will continue if the message is:
    - Not from a Fleet team member
    - Posted outside of Fleet’s business hours
    - In a specific customer channel (manually designated by Customer Success)   
3. (Zendesk) Search for an existing Zendesk ticket by the Slack thread ID or create one if it does not exist.
4. (Slack) If a new Zendesk ticket was created, reply to the Slack message in a thread.
    - Hi @username, it's currently outside Fleet's support hours. (6am - 4pm PT). We've created a support ticket based on your message, and a Fleet team member will respond as soon as possible. If you have more questions or comments, feel free to reply in this thread, and we'll add them to the ticket.
5. (Zendesk) If an existing Zendesk ticket was found by the search, add the Slack message to the existing ticket as a new comment.

![Screen Shot 2022-12-01 at 11 39 54 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114112018/205109512-d35f4907-1169-41f5-acab-e23e3506e050.png)

#### Things to note: 
- New customer channels that the automation will run in must be configured manually. Submit requests for additions during automation office hours.
- New tickets created from thread replies will contain a link to the slack thread, but will only have the new message. 
- This zap does not support file uploads and attachments. Tickets created for messages with images attached will not have the attachments, and the automation will not run if someone uploads a file without a message.

* Complete consensus training videos (see the "Description" field in the `#help-consensus-tool` slack channel.
* Review [gong](gong.io) calls.
* Get trained on [Demo2Win](https://2winglobal.com/about-you/pre-sales/)

### Within 60 days -- synthesize

* Arriving to the demo without a plan. Ensure that you have a pre-call strategy meeting with your AE prior to the external call. Understand who you are presenting to. [Look at some tips on walnut.io](https://www.walnut.io/post/7-sales-demo-mistakes-and-how-to-avoid-them)
* Conducting a product training
* Live troubleshooting. We all love to solve problems, but don't get de-railed from showing value to your audience.
* Talking over your prospect. [Just don't do it](https://emissary.io/cardinal-sins-of-sales-demos/).

## Responsibilities

### Send a quote
During the buying cycle, the champion will need to start the process to secure funding in cooperation with the economic buyer and the finance org.

All quotes and purchase orders must be approved by CRO before being sent to the prospect or customer. Often, the CRO will request Fleet business operations/legal of any unique terms required.

The Fleet owner of the opportunity (usually AE or CSM) will prepare a quote and/or a Purchase Order when requested.
- Because the champion may need to socialize "what is Fleet" or "what are we getting when buying Fleet," it is most often best to send the quote in [slide form](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15kbqm0OYPf1OmmTZvDp4F7VvMERnX4K6TMYqCYNr-wI/edit?usp=sharing).
- Docusign can be used to create a [standard Purchase Order](https://www.loom.com/share/Loom-Message-16-January-2023-2ba8cf195ec645ebabac267d7df59823?sid=214f8c6b-beb3-427a-a3a8-e8c20b5dc350) if no special terms or pricing are needed.

### Review rep activity
Following up with people interested in Fleet is an important part of finding out whether or not they'd like to continue the process of buying the product.  It is also very important not to be annoying.  At Fleet, team members follow up with people, but not too often.

To help coach reps and avoid being annoying to Fleet users, Fleet reviews rep activity on a regular basis following these steps:
1. In Salesforce, visit the activity report on your dashboard.  (TODO: taylor will replace this and/or link it)
2. For each rep, review recent activity from the last 30 days across all of that rep's accounts.
3. If outreach is too frequent or doesn't fit the company's strategy, then set up a 30 minute coaching session to discuss with the rep.


### Validate Salesforce data
In order to maintain a consistent contributor experience in Salesforce, we log in to make sure the structure of Salesforce data continues to look correct based on processes started elsewhere. Then we can look and see that the goals we want to achieve as a business are in line with our view inside Salesforce by conducting the following checkup. Any discrepancies between how information is presented in Salesforce and what should be in there per this ritual should be flagged so that they can be fixed or discussed.

1. Make sure the default tabs for a standard user include a detailed view of contacts, opportunities, accounts, and leads. No other tabs should exist.

2. Click the accounts tab and check for the following: 

* The default filter is Customers when you click on the accounts tab. Click on an account to continue.
* Click on a customer and make sure billing address, parent account, LinkedIn company URL, CISO employees (#), employees, and industry appear first at the top of the account. 
* Useful links section should appear in the top right section of the account page. It includes links to purchase orders (POs), signed subscription agreements, invoices sent, meeting notes, and signed NDA. Clicking these links should search the appropriate repository for the requested information pertaining to the customer. All meeting notes should be saved in the [Meeting notes](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18e-rVadHG0T5w98OKMngM-yv-K9SXaOq) folder in Google Drive with the account name and date in the title. We do not use the notes feature on "accounts" or "opportunities" in Salesforce. 
* Additional information section should include fields for account (customer) name first, account rating, LinkedIn sales navigator URL, LinkedIn company URL, and my LinkedIn overlaps. Make sure the LinkedIn links work.
* Accounting section should include the following fields: invoice sent (latest), the payment received on (latest), subscription end date (latest), press approval field, license key, total opportunities (#), deals won (#), close date (first deal), cumulative revenue, payment terms, billing address, and shipping address. 
* Opportunities, meeting notes, and activity feed should appear on the right.  

3. Click on the opportunities tab and check for the following:

* Default filter should be all opportunities. Open an opportunity to continue.
* Section at the top of the page should include fields for account name, amount, close date, next step, and opportunity owner.
* Opportunity information section should include fields for account name, opportunity name (should have the year on it), amount, next step, next step's due date, close date, and stage.
* The accounting section here should include: up to # of hosts, type, payment terms, billing process, term, reseller, effective date, subscription end date, invoice sent, and the date payment was received.
* Stage history, activity feed, and LinkedIn sales navigator should appear at the right.  

4. Click on the contacts tab and check for the following:

* Default filter should be all contacts. Open a contact to continue.
* Top section should have fields for the contact's name, job title, department, account name, LinkedIn, and Orbit feed. 
* The second section should have fields for LinkedIn URL, account name, name, title, is champion, and reports to
* Additional information should have fields for email, personal email, Twitter, GitHub, mobile, website, orbit feed, and description.
* Related contacts section should exist at the bottom, activity feed, meeting notes reminder, and manager information should appear on the right. 

5. Click on the leads tab and check for the following:

* Default filter should be all leads. Open a lead to continue.
* There should be fields for name, lead source, lead status, and rating.


### Invite new customer DRI
Sometimes there is a change in the champion within the customer's organization.
1. Get an introduction to the new DRIs including names, roles, contact information.
2. Make sure they're in the Slack channel.
3. Invite them to the *Success* meetings.
4. In the first meeting understand their proficiency level of osquery.
    1. Make sure the meeting time is still convenient for their team. 
    2. Understand their needs and goals for visibility.
    3. Offer training to get them up to speed.
    4. Provide a white glove experience.

### Get technical help with customer request
The web chat will be monitored by an on-call rotation. If you are unable to answer a technical/product question, ask the Solution Consultant (SC) in [#g-sales](https://fleetdm.slack.com/archives/C030A767HQV). If the SC is unavailable, post in [#help-engineering](https://fleetdm.slack.com/archives/C019WG4GH0A) / [#help-product](https://fleetdm.slack.com/archives/C02A8BRABB5) accordingly.
Transition to the next week on Friday night into Saturday (e.g. Carlos’s shift starts at 12am on 1/21 for the week of 1/23)
Respond “in-thread” in Slack “_from-prospective-customers”. In-channel reminders for the next person starting their on-call shift are automated with notifications issued every Monday at the beginning of the day.
- Fleet employees can find other expectations for action and response times in this [internal document](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/104-TRXlY55g303q2xazY1bpcDx4dHqS5O5VdJ05OwzE/edit?usp=sharing



### Schedule a customer call
To schedule an [ad hoc meeting](https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/ad%20hoc) with a Fleet customer, use the ["Customer meeting" Calendly link](https://calendly.com/fleetdm/customer).
- **Documenting a customer call:** When we do prospect calls, add the customer's name in both the google doc title and the heading, ex. "Charlie (Fleet)."  This makes it easier when searching for the document later. 
- **Before a customer call(48hrs):** Check the calendar invite 48hrs before the meeting to determine if the customer has accepted the invitation.
  - If the customer has not accepted the invitation, reach out to confirm attendance (e.g., EAs, email, Slack).
  - Test the Zoom Meeting link to make sure that it is working.
  - Make sure that agenda documents are attached and accessible to meeting attendees (as appropriate to the situation).
- **Day of the customer call:** Join the meeting two to three minutes before the start time.

- **Missed customer call:** If the customer does not join the call after three minutes, contact the customer with
  - Slack, if we have a shared channel.
  - email, using the email address from the calendar invite.
  - LinkedIn, send a direct message.
  - phone, try finding their number to text and/or call (as appropriate to the device type: landline vs. cell phone).
  - an alternative date and time. Suggest two to three options from which the customer can choose.
    - Confirm that contact information is accurate and that the customer can receive and access meeting invites.

### Close a new customer deal
To close a deal with a new customer (non-self-service), create a GitHub issue using the ["Sale" issue template](https://github.com/fleetdm/confidential/issues/new?assignees=hollidayn%2Czayhanlon&labels=project%2C%23cx%2C%23sales%2C%23business-operations&template=3-sale.md&title=New+customer%3A+_____________) and follow the steps.

> TODO: dedupe between this section and the "Sale" issue template

This workflow outlines the process that sales and customer success can follow when a new deal closes. 

1. (AE) A customer is sent an order form
    - If the customer requires the use of their own legal contract, the account executive (AE) sends that contract to the business operations (BizOps) team for review. Then: 
    - If the customer can use DocuSign, the AE sends out the order form. The AE must cc themselves and BizOps on the order so that all parties receive a fully executed copy when signing is complete. 
    - If the customer does not use DocuSign, the AE sends out the order form directly to the customer. 
        - The AE then sends the paper signed copy to BizOps for Fleet review and execution (via DocuSign by the CEO).  
        - BizOps will cc the AE and stay cc’d on the contract when the final copy is sent to the CEO for Fleet execution. 
        - Note: The Chief Revenue Officer serves as the backup to BizOps
2. The Customer and Fleet sign the order form.
    - (AE) The AE adds the fully executed contract to the opportunity record.
    - (AE) The AE marks the opportunity 'Closed Won' and includes the 'Closing Date'.
    - (BizOps) BizOps team member adds fully executed contract to the [subscriptions folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1kwwg8RmnT8DyPLDDYLiJ7w5legDEPc57) (internal drive) in Fleet drive
    - (AE) Help BizOps secure a PO from the new customer to be referenced on invoice.
3. (AE) The AE creates a 'New Sale Issue'
    - They complete the AE tasks listed at the top of the issue.
    - Then they assign the issue to BizOps and the Head of Customer Success (CS).
    - AE completes the Business Objectives section of the Account Plan located in the Sales> Opportunities> {Account Name} shared google drive folder.
    - Solutions Consultant completes the Technical Objectives section of the Account Plan located in the Sales> Opportunities> {Account Name} shared google drive folder.
    - AE moves the {Account Name} folder within Opportunities to the Sales> Account Plans folder.
    - The AE schedules a 30 minute internal handoff call with CS and any other related parties to the sale. 
    - Prepare to review the following from the Account Plan:

### Submit a customer contract
Fleet's subscription agreement is available at [fleetdm.com/terms](https://fleetdm.com/terms). 

#### Contract terms
- **Effective date:** The start date for the subscription service.
- **Close date:** The date the last party to the contract signed the agreement.
- **Invoice date:** The date that Fleet sent the invoice to the customer.

Fleeties can find a summary of contract terms in the relevant [customer's Salesforce opportunity.](https://fleetdm.lightning.force.com/lightning/o/Opportunity/list?filterName=Recent)

#### Standard terms
For all subscription agreements, NDAs, and similar contracts, Fleet maintains a [standard set of terms and maximum allowable adjustments for those terms](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gAenC948YWG2NwcaVHleUvX0LzS8suyMFpjaBqxHQNg/edit#gid=1136345578).

Exceptions to these maximum allowable adjustments always require CEO approval, whether in the form of redlines to Fleet's agreements or in terms on a prospective customer's own contract.

#### Non-standard NDAs
To get a non-standard NDA (a non-disclosure agreement from another party) signed, [request a legal review](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/business-operations#intake).

#### Reviewing subscription agreement
To quickly get help doing a legal review of a prospect subscription agreement, with or without redlines:

1. Visit https://github.com/fleetdm/confidential/issues/new/choose
2. Select "Contract signature or legal review"
3. Follow the instructions in the "Submitting this request" section

If the prospect/customer/partner is originating the request for signature:
1. Communicate to the prospect that the Fleet signatory is Mike McNeil, CEO and share his email.
2. Mike will create the github issue mentioned above when he gets request
3. Mike will forward to business operations for review
4. Business operations will notify Mike and the requestor (via GitHub comment w/ at-mention) when ready for signature
5. Mike will sign and close the issue.  (This sends a notification to the requestor automatically.)


### Process customer support request 
This section outlines Fleet's customer and community support process.
- The customer support engineering (CSE) team handles basic help desk resolution and service delivery issues (P3 and P4) with assistance from L2 on-call and the solutions architecture team as needed.
- The CSE team handles in depth technical issues (P1 and P2) in conjunction with L2 on-call.
- The CSE team handles expert technical product and services support in coordination with the L2 and L3 on-call technicians.

Whenever possible, the resulting solution should be documented as an update to an existing FAQ guide or new documentation article.

The support process is accomplished via on-call rotation and the weekly on-call retro meeting.

The on-call engineer holds responsibility for responses to technical Slack comments, Slack threads, and GitHub issues raised by customers and the community, which the Customer Success team cannot handle.

Support issues should be handled in the relevant Slack channel rather than Direct Messages (DMs). This will ensure that questions and solutions can be easily referenced in the future. If it is necessary to use DMs to share sensitive information, a summary of the conversation should be posted in the Slack channel as well. 

The weekly on-call retro at Fleet provides time to discuss highlights and answer the following questions about the previous week's on-call:

1. What went well?

2. What could have gone better?

3. What should we remember next time?

This way, the Fleet team can constantly improve the effectiveness and experience during future on-call rotations.

### Document customer requests
1. Required details that will help speed up time to resolution:
    - Fleet server version
    - Agent version 
        - Osquery or fleetd?
    - Operating system
    - Web browser
    - Expected behavior
    - Actual behavior
2. Details that are nice to have but not required. These may be requested by Fleet support as needed:
    - Amount of total hosts
    - Amount of online hosts
    - Amount of scheduled queries
    - Amount and size (CPU/Mem) of the Fleet instances
    - Fleet instances CPU and Memory usage while the issue has been happening
    - MySQL flavor/version in use
    - MySQL server capacity (CPU/Mem)
    - MySQL CPU and Memory usage while the issue has been happening
    - Are MySQL read replicas configured? If so, how many?
    - Redis version and server capacity (CPU/Mem)
    - Is Redis running in cluster mode?
    - Redis CPU and Memory usage while the issue has been happening
    - The output of fleetctl debug archive

#### Create customer support Issue
Locate the relevant issue or create it if it doesn't already exist (to avoid duplication, be creative when searching GitHub for issues - it can often take a couple of tries with different keywords to find an existing issue). 

When creating a new issue, make sure the following:
- Make sure the issue has a "customer request" label.
- "+" prefixed labels (e.g., "+more info please") indicate we are waiting on an answer from an external community member who does not work at Fleet or that no further action is needed from the Fleet team until an external community member, who doesn't work at Fleet, replies with a comment. At this point, our bot will automatically remove the +-prefixed label.
- Is the issue straightforward and easy to understand, with appropriate context (default to public: declassify into public issues in fleetdm/fleet whenever possible)?
- Is there a key date or timeframe that the customer hopes to meet?  If so, please post about that in #g-product with a link to the issue, so the team can discuss it before committing to a time frame.
- Have we provided a link to that issue for the customer to remind everyone of the plan and for the sake of visibility, so other folks who weren't directly involved are up to speed  (e.g., "Hi everyone, here's a link to the issue we discussed on today's call: […link…](https://omfgdogs.com)")?

##### Assistance from engineering
Customer team members can reach the engineering oncall for assistance by writing a message with `@oncall` in the [#help-engineering](https://fleetdm.slack.com/archives/C019WG4GH0A) channel of the Fleet Slack. Additional help can be obtained by messaging your friendly Solutions Consultant in the [#help-solutions-consulting channel](https://fleetdm.slack.com/archives/C05HZ2LHEL8).

### Respond to customer support request
When a customer encounters an unexpected error on fleetdm.com, it is important that we contact them quickly to resolve the issue. 

If you need to reach out to a customer to resolve an error, you can use one of the templates below. The full list of response email templates is available in this [Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-DvPSBnFbsa2hlr02rAGy2GBTwE0Gx03jV94AStTYf4/edit).

#### Error while purchasing a Fleet Premium license
```
"Hi [company name] team, I just noticed you ran into an error signing up for a license key on fleetdm.com. 

I’m so sorry about that! Were fixing the issue now and I’ve refunded your payment and bumped your license to add an additional three hosts for the year as well.

I’ll let you know when your account is sorted and follow up with instructions to access your Fleet Premium licenses.

Thanks for bearing with us, please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions about this, Fleet, osquery, or anything else!"
```

#### Error while running a live query in Fleet Sandbox
```
"Hey there, the team and I just noticed you experienced a 500 error that may have affected your experience running a live query on https://fleetdm.com/.

I wanted to personally apologize for our mistake and let you know we're looking into the problem. We’ll provide an update on the underlying fix and track an (anonymized) bug on https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet so you can follow the progress in the open.

Thank you for trying Fleet!"
```

### Change customer credit card number
You can help a Premium license dispenser customers change their credit card by directing them to their [account dashboard](https://fleetdm.com/customers/dashboard). On that page, the customer can update their billing card by clicking the pencil icon next to their billing information.

### Restart Algolia manually
At least once every hour, an Algolia crawler reindexes the Fleet website's content. If an error occurs while the website is being indexed, Algolia will block our crawler and respond to requests with this message: `"This action cannot be executed on a blocked crawler"`.

When this happens, you'll need to manually start the crawler in the [Algolia crawler dashboard](https://crawler.algolia.com/admin/) to unblock it. 
You can do this by logging into the crawler dashboard using the login saved in 1password and clicking the "Restart crawling" button on our crawler's "overview" page](https://crawler.algolia.com/admin/crawlers/497dd4fd-f8dd-4ffb-85c9-2a56b7fafe98/overview).

No further action is needed if the crawler successfully reindexes the Fleet website. If another error occurs while the crawler is running, take a screenshot of the error and add it to the GitHub issue created for the alert and @mention `eashaw` for help.


### Generate a trial license key
1. Fleet's self-service license key creator is the best way to generate a proof of concept (POC) or renewal/expansion Fleet Premium license key. 
    - [Here is a tutorial on using the self-service method](https://www.loom.com/share/b519e6a42a7d479fa628e394ee1d1517) (internal video)
    - Pre-sales license key DRI is the Director of Solutions Consulting
    - Post-sales license key DRI is the VP of Customer Success

2. Legacy method: [create an opportunity issue](https://github.com/fleetdm/confidential/issues/new/choose) for the customer and follow the instructions in the issue for generating a trial license key.


### Extend sandbox trial
If a Fleet user would like an extension on the 5 day sandbox trial, this can be accomplished by creating a new confidential issue with labels `g-infra` and `:release`. It is important to include the projected expiration date of the sandbox trial, as sandbox instances cannot be extended after they expire. Please note the user email address that is requesting the sandbox extension in the confidential issue.
