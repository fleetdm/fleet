# Handbook

## About the handbook

The Fleet handbook is inspired by the [GitLab team handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/about/).  It shares the same [advantages](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/about/#advantages) and will probably undergo a similar [evolution](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/ceo/#evolution-of-the-handbook).

While [GitLab's handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/) inspires this handbook, it is nowhere near as complete (yet!)  We will continue adding and updating this handbook and gradually migrating information from [Fleet's shared Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1StSOI3HNcsl9VleXxNWfUBT2co7h44OG) as time allows.

## Handbook style guide

### Headings

Headings help readers scan content to find what they need easily. Organize page content using clear headings specific to the topic they describe.

Keep headings brief and organize them in a logical order:

* H1: Page title
* H2: Main headings
* H3: Subheadings
* H4: Sub-subheadings (headings nested under subheadings)

Try to stay within three or four heading levels. Complicated documents may use more, but pages with a simpler structure are easier to read.
