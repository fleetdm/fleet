# Demand gen/marketing operations

Drive efficient, scalable pipeline growth by building and optimizing the systems, processes, and campaigns that attract, nurture, and convert high-quality leads into revenue—enabling the sales team to focus on closing while we focus on filling the funnel.

##  Go to market model

Our go-to-market approach is built on a foundation of end-to-end visibility. We want to track touchpoint from first engagement through closed revenue, connecting marketing activity to pipeline and revenue. This means instrumenting our campaigns, content, and channels with consistent attribution, maintaining clean data flow between our marketing automation and CRM systems, and building reporting that ties spend and effort directly to outcomes. The goal isn't data for data's sake—it's to create a feedback loop where we can see what's working, double down on high-performing channels, cut what isn't delivering, and continuously refine our targeting, messaging, and timing. Every campaign we run should make us smarter about the next one.
