## Programs
Fleet's community programs are rooted in several areas; created to nurture communication between all current and future Fleet users through events, community support, [social media](#social-media), conversation-starting, ads, video, and articles.

### Social media
Fleet's largest asset is our user community, the people actually using Fleet. Public conversations on social media create valuable opportunities for contributors to answer technical questions and collect feedback.

Fleet [does not self-promote](https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Impact-Equation-Audiobook/B00AR1VFBU).  (Great brands are [magnanimous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnanimity).)

Here are some topics for social media posts:
- Fleet the product
- Internal progress
- Highlighting community contributions
- Highlighting Fleet and osquery accomplishments
- Industry news about osquery
- Industry news about device management
- Upcoming events, interviews, and podcasts

### Swag requests
We deliver Fleet swag for those who request it through [Fleet documentation](https://fleetdm.com/docs) and may occasionally have upstanding community members and customers who are in need of some cool Fleet swag as well.

#### Fulfilling Printful orders
On a weekly basis, Marketing must log in to [Printful](https://www.printful.com/) and complete any draft orders so that they are sent. We currently only ship within the 48 contiguous United States and approve one free order per household under normal circumstances.

To do this:

1. Go to the ["Orders"](https://www.printful.com/ca/dashboard/default/orders) page in Printful
2. Look for an order status of "Draft" and click that order.
3. Copy the address displayed in the draft order. Close the modal.
4. Under "Order list", there's a search box for customers that you will need to paste the address.
5. The results should only display one order. Any additional could be duplicate orders or those made in error.
6. Repeat this process until all remaining draft orders show "Waiting for Fulfillment"

#### Fulfilling Postal orders

There are many times in which community members, customers, and contributors are in need of some cool Fleet swag. We use [Postal](https://www.postal.com/) to fulfill these swag requests. Postal warehouses Fleet swag that is available to send directly. There are two main ways to send swag through Printful. Direct sends and Magic Links.

##### Magic Link
This is a great option to send when we only know the item we'd like to send and want the recipient to fill out their own contact information and shipping details. These links can be used by anyone who has access to the link, so only send to the desired recipient.

- Log in to [Postal](https://app.postal.io/items/postals) and make sure "Approved items" is checked in the top left.
- For approved items, hover over the item that you would like to send and click the chain icon.
- Make sure order limit is 1
- Personalize your magic link page with a customized header or message if you'd like.
- Continue on to "Review" and "Create MagicLink"

##### Direct send
This is a great option to send when we already have the name, address, and email address of the person we are sending an item to.

- Log in to [Postal](https://app.postal.io/items/postals) and make sure "Approved items" is checked in the top left.
- For approved items, hover over the item that you would like to send and click the paper airplane icon.
- Choose the "Direct" tab and find an existing contact or create a new one.
- To create a new contact click the plus sign and fill out the name, email, and shipping address.
- Select "Configure your item", continue on to "Review", and "Confirm and Send"

##### Send swag for community contributions to Fleet
- Reach out to the contributor to thank them for their contribution
- Consider sharing the contribution on social media
- Ask if we could send the contributor any swag
- If yes, follow the steps of creating a magic link in Postal to send.
