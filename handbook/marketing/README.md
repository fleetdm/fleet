### Prepare "Let's get you set up!" meeting notes

Before each group call, copy the attendees from the "Lets get you set up! (group office hours)" calendar event and paste them into the correct section of the ["Let's get you set up!" meeting notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rlvueDlTqiz0cyH426nVL6LXpv9MWDUtXW6YiMT3oK8/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.l967l3n9mjnd), be sure to use the format listed in the doc.


### Refresh event calendar

Fleet's Head of Marketing is directly responsible for the accuracy of event locations, attendance dates, and CFP deadlines in the event strategy workbook.  At the end of every quarter, the Head of Marketing updates every event in the ["Event strategy workbook"](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YQXAX2Q_WnGkAwMYjMbQpV3nbCj7gOBbv7Y0u4twxzQ/edit) (private Google doc) by following these steps:
1. Visit the latest website for each event.
2. Update the workbook with the latest location, dates, and CFP deadlines from the website.


### Begin or modify an advertising campaign

Any new ads or changes to current running ads are approved in ["🦢🗣 Design review (:help-design)"](https://github.com/orgs/fleetdm/projects/93).

To propose an ad, or a change to an ad:
1. Evaluate the buying situation before proposing any changes to ads. This determines the audience that will see each ad and which campaign it will be placed in. (Device management, vuln management, endpoint ops - security, endpoint ops - IT)
2. Experiment campaigns must follow the YYYY-MM-DD._{buying_situation}-{ad_name}_ format. (2024-01-12.mdm - Cross-platform MDM waitlist)
3. Image ads should follow the recommended size, centering, and asset guidelines. These are available on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/1J2yxqH8Q7u8V7YTtA1iej/Social-media-(logos%2C-covers%2C-banners)?type=design&node-id=2078-100840&mode=design&t=cHriEw2E7hLxgwuG-0).
4. Add your proposed ads to the ["🧫 Experiment review" agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e2TFsV0JFFym7MvCUrJR1Wr2DVmqUgboKYFUXBEmCyI/edit#heading=h.kvp9pcc0kkq) (private Google doc) and attend the next episode.  During the meeting, existing ads will be compared against the newly proposed ads within the corresponding ad platform. ([Google Ads](https://ads.google.com/home/), [LinkedIn Campaign Manager](https://www.linkedin.com/campaignmanager/), etc.)
5. Make revisions and re-attend the meeting as needed until the planned change is executed.
7. Create a calendar reminder to check ad performance two weeks from the date changes were made.


### Promote a post on LinkedIn

1. Create a classic campaign under ["Experiments"](https://www.linkedin.com/campaignmanager/accounts/509911695/campaigns?campaignGroupIds=%5B678398233%5D) following the YYYY-MM-DD.buying-situation - ad description with a goal of website visits or engagement to run for two weeks.
2. Choose the appropriate audience according to the buying situation and disable audience expansion and the LinkedIn audience network. 
3. When creating the ad for the new campaign, select "browse existing content" and find the post under the employee tab.
4. Launch campaign once approved.


### Settle content strategy

The Head of Marketing is the DRI for deploying Fleet's outward-facing content. The content schedule is settled significantly in advance to provide ample time for strategy and planning. Use the following steps to settle content strategy:

1. Using the [content calendar](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Hso0LxqwrRVINCyW_n436bNHmoqhoLhC8bcbvLPOs9A/edit?gid=809357993#gid=809357993), propose the content that Fleet will produce in the current quarter, and the strategy behind that content, including:
  - Release date: The date by which the content will be complete and finalized.
  - DRI: Person(s) responsible for the project management of this content.
  - Title (e.g. "Article: Fleet takes bacon to new heights with flying pigs release").
2. Attend a 30m meeting with Fleet's Client Platform Engineer & Community Advocate, CTO, and CEO to review and settle the proposed content.



### Fleet events
We sponsor and participate in events so that we can support, connect, engage, and grow the Fleet community. We need to be thoughtful about what events we sponsor or host, and we need to be disciplined in how we run events so we can be efficient and effective.

There are three phases to running an event at FleetDM,
- **Phase 1:** Propose, review and approve new events
- **Phase 2:** Manage and and execute approved events
- **Phase 3:** Event postgame

#### Phase 1 Propose, review and approve new events
**Objective:**  To ensure that the organization is aligned with the investment of time and resources to execute an event
This process is managed through Fleet Issues and is summarized in a detailed tracking spreadsheet.

See the section "Settle event strategy" below for the process.

##### Settle event strategy (approve proposed events)

Anyone at Fleet can propose a future event.
Fleet's [Content Specialist](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/marketing#team) serves as the project manager for efficiently executing Fleet events. Events are settled in advance to provide ample time for strategy and planning. This includes any event that Fleet pays to attend or sponsor, and even events where Fleet's only involvement is that a Fleetie will give a talk or otherwise represent the brand.
- Field/sales events and GitOps workshops are settled 1 sprint in advance.
- Conferences are settled 1 quarter in advance. 

Once events have been settled for a particular time frame, i.e, decided in a previous event strategy session, Fleet does not make changes except in extreme circumstances.

1. Add all upcoming proposed and approved events to the ["🫧 Proposed events (not yet settled)" tab](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YQXAX2Q_WnGkAwMYjMbQpV3nbCj7gOBbv7Y0u4twxzQ/edit?gid=1411322737#gid=1411322737) of the 🎪 Events spreadsheet (confidential doc). Propose the events that Fleet will attend and the strategy for those events, including:
  - Who from Fleet will attend?
  - The training plan for Fleet attendees.
  - Which talk proposal will Fleet submit?
  - All event materials, including printouts, banners, swag given out, and even the clothing worn by Fleeties.
  - Estimated budget, including sponsorship or airfare, and lodging for attendees.
2. Set up and attend a 30m meeting with the CMO, Head of Demand Generation, Head of GTM Architecture, and Manager of Training and Enablement.
  - First, during this meeting, Marketing will decide which field/sales events and GitOps workshops Fleet will execute in the **following sprint**.
  - Next, Marketing will decide which conferences in the **following quarter** the company will invest time or money into. 
3. After the meeting, the Content Specialist will communicate the settled events by
  - Moving all settled events to the "All 🎪 Official (planned & settled events)" tab of the 🎪 Events spreadsheet (confidential doc).
  - Using the following template, post a message in the [#oooh-events Slack channel](https://fleetdm.slack.com/archives/C054TGK0H7X).

```
:fleet-swan: Hi all!
Here are the [upcoming settled events](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YQXAX2Q_WnGkAwMYjMbQpV3nbCj7gOBbv7Y0u4twxzQ/edit?gid=692710204#gid=692710204) where you can find :fleet:Fleet!
```

4. Close all proposed event issues that weren't able to be prioritized with a comment explaining why.

#### Phase 2 Manage and and execute approved events
**Objective** To efficiently plan, organize,track and complete the tasks in order to excecute an event. This covers everything from once an event is approved to when the event is finished.  From detail planning to promotion, staff assignments to logistics, events can be complicated projects that need focused attention.

Event execution needs to plan and track the detail decisions supporting:

1. **All Event Logistics.** (Location, Venue, Start and End Date/Time, Event Website, Shipping, Staff schedules, costs, and more)
2. **Speaking sessions:** (Location, time, talk metadata(title, abstract, etc), av requirements, and more)
3. **Event Pre Promotion:** (landing page, blog, social, email, customers, prospects, etc)
4. **Lead capture plans and process:** (scanning process, qualifying questions)
5. **Booth:** Design, messaging, staffing hours and assignments, attire, swag, power, etc.)
6. **Key vendor relationships:** (Event Organizer, booth builder, site logisitcs, scanning tech, av tech)

This will be managed in a structure central document for each event so that attendees and organizers have a central place to find information and collaborate. 

(Template details TBD)

#### Phase 3 Event postgame
**Objective** To consistently wrap up an event, gather lessons learned, and ensure the organization follows through with our new relationships.  

After the event there are three important activites that need to be completed.

1. **Update CRM:** The CRM is our single source of truth about our relationships. So, it is critical that all the information from what happened at the event is promptly updated in the CRM.
2. **Follow up:** When we make new friends and connections at an event, we must be prompt in follow through and connecting with them after the event. The CRM is the main way to prompt the right person at Fleet to reach back out and follow up.
3. **Post Mortem:** Learn and improve from the previous event. (gather feedback, review lessons learned, and update processes and strategy)

(Template details TBD)

### Website traffic Looker dashboard 
<!-- 2025-11-29 This heading doesn't follow the format of a responsibility (https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/leadership#outline-of-departmental-page-structure). However, we will leave the title as is in preparation for moving it to a separate page, not yet created-->

This dashboard is the first iteration of a tracking website that monitors performance, traffic acquisition, and key event conversions. It is updated daily and is essential for tracking the success of marketing initiatives.

**Dashboard Link:** [Website Traffic by Source](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/612ee012-b35a-42d3-8806-3ff0728dde58)

#### Simple summary

The Website Traffic Dashboard provides a comprehensive view of how users interact with the Fleet website. It tracks overall health metrics, such as **Total Users**, **Bounce Rate**, and **Sessions per user**, alongside detailed breakdowns of **traffic sources** and **conversion performance**. It is a critical tool for measuring the effectiveness of our organic and paid strategies, identifying high-performing content, and spotting trends in user behavior and goal completion.

#### Key views description

The dashboard is structured with a side navigation menu that allows you to dive into specific areas of performance:

##### 1\. WebTraffic dashboard (overview)

This is the main landing page, providing a high-level snapshot of website performance for the selected date range.

* **Top Metrics:** Shows current values and trends for Total Users, Bounce Rate, Average session duration, and Sessions per user.  
* **Volume Chart:** Tracks the daily/monthly volume of Views, Total users, and Sessions.  
* **Acquisition Table:** The table further down breaks down traffic by **Session / medium** (e.g., google / organic, google / cpc, (direct) / (none)), providing total users, engagement rate, and key event volume for each channel.

##### 2\. Organic traffic

This view isolates the performance of all non-paid traffic, which is a major focus for content and SEO efforts.

* **Channel Trends:** The chart shows the total users over time broken down by specific organic channels: **Organic Search**, Organic Video, Organic Social, and Organic Shopping.  
* **Usage:** Used to track the growth of our SEO efforts and the health of our overall content visibility.

##### 3\. Traffic by landing page

This view is crucial for understanding how specific pages on the site are performing in attracting and engaging users.

* **Performance Table:** Lists the top-performing **Landing Pages** by **Total users** and displays their corresponding **Bounce rate**.  
* **Key Pages:** Allows us to quickly identify our most popular entry points (e.g., the homepage /, /docs/get-started/why-fleet, /pricing) and assess content quality based on bounce rate.

##### 4\. Key events

This section tracks the **volume** of our most important user actions on the website, allowing us to see how marketing activity correlates with goal completion.

* **Events over time:** The chart tracks the total number of key events (e.g., form\_submit, purchase, fleet\_website\_contact\_forms, and fleet\_website\_swag\_request) completed over the time range.  
* **Usage:** Helps identify peak periods for event completion and measure the absolute success of lead generation forms.

##### 5\. Key event conversion rates

This view displays the website's efficiency by tracking the rate at which users complete a key event. Conversion rate is generally a stronger indicator of performance than event volume alone.

- **Conversion Rates:** Displays the **User Key Event Rate** for primary goals, including:  
  - **Sign Up Form (Sign up for Fleet):** Tracks the rate of fleet\_website\_sign\_up.  
  - **Contact Us (or Request Demo):** Tracks the rate of fleet website contact forms.  
  - **Swag:** Tracks the rate of fleet\_website\_swag\_request.  
- **Usage:** Used to monitor A/B test results, measure the quality of traffic from different channels, and ensure key pathways in the product/website are optimized.
