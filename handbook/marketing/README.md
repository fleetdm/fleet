Here are some topics for social media posts:
- Fleet the product
- Internal progress
- Highlighting community contributions
- Highlighting Fleet and osquery accomplishments

### Swag requests
We deliver Fleet swag for those who request it through [Fleet documentation](https://fleetdm.com/docs) and may occasionally have upstanding community members and customers who are in need of some cool Fleet swag as well.

#### Fulfilling Printful orders
On a weekly basis, Marketing must log in to [Printful](https://www.printful.com/) and complete any draft orders so that they are sent. We currently only ship within the 48 contiguous United States and approve one free order per household under normal circumstances.

To do this:

1. Go to the ["Orders"](https://www.printful.com/ca/dashboard/default/orders) page in Printful
2. Look for an order status of "Draft" and click that order.
3. Copy the address displayed in the draft order. Close the modal.
4. Under "Order list", there's a search box for customers that you will need to paste the address.
5. The results should only display one order. Any additional could be duplicate orders or those made in error.
6. Repeat this process until all remaining draft orders show "Waiting for Fulfillment"

#### Fulfilling Postal orders

There are many times in which community members, customers, and contributors are in need of some cool Fleet swag. We use [Postal](https://www.postal.com/) to fulfill these swag requests. Postal warehouses Fleet swag that is available to send directly. There are two main ways to send swag through Printful. Direct sends and Magic Links.

##### Magic Link
This is a great option to send when we only know the item we'd like to send and want the recipient to fill out their own contact information and shipping details. These links can be used by anyone who has access to the link, so only send to the desired recipient.

- Log in to [Postal](https://app.postal.io/items/postals) and make sure "Approved items" is checked in the top left.
- For approved items, hover over the item that you would like to send and click the chain icon.
- Make sure order limit is 1
- Personalize your magic link page with a customized header or message if you'd like.
- Continue on to "Review" and "Create MagicLink"

##### Direct send
This is a great option to send when we already have the name, address, and email address of the person we are sending an item to.

- Log in to [Postal](https://app.postal.io/items/postals) and make sure "Approved items" is checked in the top left.
- For approved items, hover over the item that you would like to send and click the paper airplane icon.
- Choose the "Direct" tab and find an existing contact or create a new one.
- To create a new contact click the plus sign and fill out the name, email, and shipping address.
- Select "Configure your item", continue on to "Review", and "Confirm and Send"

##### Send swag for community contributions to Fleet
- Reach out to the contributor to thank them for their contribution
- Consider sharing the contribution on social media
- Ask if we could send the contributor any swag
- If yes, follow the steps of creating a magic link in Postal to send.

### Press
From time to time, Fleet is in the news.  Here are a few examples:
- Computer World: [Fleet announces open-source, cross-platform MDM solution](https://www.computerworld.com/article/3692916/fleet-announces-open-source-cross-platform-mdm-solution.html)
- 9to5Mac: [Apple @ Work Podcast: Fleet announces open-source, cross-platform device management platform](https://9to5mac.com/2023/04/11/fleet-announces-open-source-cross-platform-device-management-platform/)
- Open Source For U: [Fleet Unveils The First Ever Open Source, Cross-Platform Device Management Platform](https://www.opensourceforu.com/2023/04/fleet-unveils-the-first-ever-open-source-cross-platform-device-management-platform/)
- Tech Switch: [Fleet announces open-source, cross-platform MDM solution](https://techswitchcf.com/fleet-announces-open-source-cross-platform-mdm-solution/)
- TechCrunch: [Fleet nabs $20M to enable enterprises to manage their devices](https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/28/fleet-nabs-20m-to-enable-enterprises-to-manage-their-devices)

### Create a press release
After creating a press release, it is pitched reporters as an exclusive story. If the story is accepted do not share or publicize any information related to the upcoming press release before the announcement. Also, see [What is a press exclusive, and how does it work](https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-press-exclusive-and-how-does-it-work) on Quora.

#### Press release boilerplate

<blockquote purpose="large-quote"> Fleet gives teams fast, reliable access to data about the production servers, employee laptops, and other devices they manage - no matter the operating system. Users can search for any device data using SQL queries, making it faster to respond to incidents and automate IT. Fleet is also used to monitor vulnerabilities, battery health, and software. It can even monitor endpoint detection and response and mobile device management tools like Crowdstrike, Munki, Jamf, and Carbon Black, to help confirm that those platforms are working how administrators think they are. Fleet is open source software. It's easy to deploy and get started quickly, and it even comes with an enterprise-friendly free tier available under the MIT license.

IT and security teams love Fleet because of its flexibility and conventions. Instead of secretly collecting as much data as possible, Fleet defaults to privacy and transparency, capturing only the data your organization needs to meet its compliance, security, and management goals, with clearly-defined, flexible limits.   

That means better privacy, better device performance, and better data but with less noise. </blockquote>


### Create branded email campaign
Create and send branded email blast to multiple recipients in small or large groups. First, base the design on one of our existing [email templates](https://www.figma.com/file/yLP0vJ8Ms4GbCoofLwptwS/?node-id=3609%3A12552) in Figma. If your Figma boots aren't comfortable (or you don't have edit access), your design could be a Google Drawing, Doc, or just a sketch on paper in a pinch. Bring your content to the #g-website design review for feedback and approval

- **For small groups:** Use "bcc" so recipients don't see each other's email addresses and send an email manually using Gmail.   (Good for small lists.  This is definitely a "thing that doesn't scale.")

- **For large groups:**  design the email and content. The preferred method is to 
- Bring your request to the brand team by posting it in [their primary Slack channel](#slack-channels), along with your urgency/timeline. The Brand team will finalize the design and language for consistency, then fork and customize [one of the existing email templates](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/blob/de280a478834a7f85772bea4f552f953c65bb29e/website/views/emails/email-order-confirmation.ejs) for you, and write a script to deliver it to your desired recipients. Then, the Brand team will merge that, test it by hand to make sure it's attractive and links work, and then tell you how to run the script with e.g.;

  `sails run deliver-release-announcement --emailAddresses='["foo@example.com","bar@example.com"]'`
