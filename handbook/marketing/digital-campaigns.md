## **Digital campaigns**

### **Overall approach: share insight**

Our approach to digital paid media is rooted in sharing and teaching. We do not pay for traditional ads; instead, we invest in distributing **high-utility knowledge and expertise** across digital channels to educate, inform, and build trust within the community.

The primary goals of our digital strategy are:

* **Generate awareness:** Increase overall awareness of FleetDM in the market.  
* **Value Distribution:** Distributing high-utility assets (Handbooks, Calculators, Reports) that answer questions and solve immediate problems.  
* **Demand Generation:** Identifying new contacts through strategic form completions.  
* **Intent Capture:** Gathering intent signals from known contacts as they engage with our technical content.  
* **Precision Targeting:** Focusing paid spend on our core ICP (target personas at organizations with \>1,000 employees) to drive high-quality "Growth Vectors".

### **Tracking & UTMs** 

To ensure accurate attribution and data visibility, we use UTMs when processing form completions to connect the dots.

#### **UTM Medium:**

For digital agency collaboration, the following utm_medium values are needed:

* **utm_medium=ps**: Paid Search (e.g., Google Search Ads)  
* **utm_medium=so**: Paid Social (e.g., LinkedIn Sponsored Content)

**UTM Campaign:**  
We use the campaigns in salesforce to keep track of roi and impact of investments. Therefore, we need to tag ads with the appropriate utm_campagn.
