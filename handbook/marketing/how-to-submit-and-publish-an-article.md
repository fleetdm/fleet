## Schedule

Publishing occurs according to our [content calendar](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IzpoIfTc7cqc9g8w20fQfap3GFcrqgOaiPrpCkowcvA/edit?usp=sharing). However, publication dates are subject to change based on the news or information that needs to be posted.

## How to submit an article

1. Submit your draft to Jarod Reyes as a Google Doc. 
2. Include any relevant images, image suggestions, or other design requests you may have.

## Review process

Articles are official Fleet communication. We carefully review published content to make sure Fleet, the company and the product, are accurately represented.

- Digital Experience will review your article for spelling, punctuation, and grammar, as well as for tone and brand consistency. 
- In some cases, a technical review by a member of Engineering or Security may be necessary. 
- After review, you may be asked to make revisions to your draft.

### Typical editing timelines are as follows:

| Type | Review time |
|:-----|:------------|
| Urgent posts |One business day |
| Non-urgent posts | Three business days | 
| Posts requiring a technical review | Three business days |

> Review times for posts requiring a technical review may vary depending on the Engineering and Security teams' schedules. E.g., if a review coincides with a product release.

## Create a PR for your article

After your article has been editied and approved, create a pull request on fleetdm.com and request review from Jarod Reyes.

### How to PR your article   

1. Familiarize yourself with our [article formatting guide](./article-formatting-guide).
2. Add a file, formatted in [Markdown](./markdown-guide), to the Fleet repo in Github [fleetdm/fleet/articles](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/tree/main/articles), using the name of your article as the filename. E.g., `deploy-fleet-on-render.md`.
3. Request a review from Jarod Reyes. 

> **IMPORTANT**: Your PR is not confidential. If the information in your article is confidential, please prepare your article in a Google Doc, or create a draft PR ~1 hour before publication time to keep your article private.

## Pre-publication checklist

- Does the article meet the original brief and keyword goals?
- Has the article been reviewed by Digital Experience for grammar edits and brand consistency?
- Does the article require a technical review?
- Do all links work correctly and open in a new window?

- Has artwork been created by Digital Experience?

## After publication

After your article is published, the Growth team will schedule your post to be promoted across our social media channels.
