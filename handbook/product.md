# Product

üõ∏ Product team (weekly) board: https://github.com/orgs/fleetdm/projects/17

üß±üì° Fleet core roadmap board: https://github.com/orgs/fleetdm/projects/8

## Job to be done

Every product should have a single job that it strives to do. At Fleet we use the [Jobs to be Done
(JTBD) framework](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/jobs-to-be-done/). Fleet's overarching job to be done is:

> I need a way to see what laptops and servers I have, and what I need to do to keep them secure and
> compliant."

## Q1 2022 product objectives

For Q1 2022, the 7 product objectives we are focused on are:

#### Ultimate source of truth

Fleet + osquery gives organizations the ability to see an almost [endless amount of
data](https://osquery.io/schema/5.1.0/) for all their devices. We want to build on this reputation
by always providing the freshest, most accurate, and most understandable data possible
in the UI and API.

##### Execution plan

We will solve the "Undetermined" performance impact limitation for new scheduled queries as well as
reflect unfinished policy runs in the UI/API. In addition, we will only advertise working
osquery tables inside the product (looking at you `wifi_networks` table). Moreover, we will improve the Fleet server's
performance and improve reliability and accuracy of the vulnerability detections.

#### Programmable

Fleet differentiate's itself from other security tools by providing a simple and easy to use API and
CLI tool (fleetctl). This allows users and customers to leverage Fleet's superb ability to gather
device data in ways that are unique to their organization.

##### Execution plan

We will add integrations for policy and vulnerability automations as well as get closer to parity
with Rapid7's vulnerability features. In addition, we will roll up software and vulnerabilities
across the entire organization and teams.

#### Who's watching the watchers

Many current Fleet users and customers hire Fleet to increase their confidence that other security
tools are functioning properly. We will continue to expose valuable information about these tools to meet customer requirements.

##### Execution plan

We will invest in sending the health of other installed agents and verify device enrollment in Jamf,
Kandji, and SimpleMDM. In addition we will roll up mobile device management (MDM) and Munki data
across the entire organization and teams.

#### Self-service, 2-way IT

Fleet is poised to enable an organization's employees to resolve issues with their devices on their own. Not only does this save time for IT administrators and security practitioners but it also builds
trust so that an organization can focus on achieving their business outcomes together.

##### Execution plan

We will focus on enabling end users to self serve issues with their devices using Fleet Desktop. In
addition, Fleet Desktop will begin to provide end users with the ability to see what information is collected
about their device (scope transparency).

#### Easy to use

We'd like to make maintaining secure laptops and servers as
easy as possible. This quarter we'll focus on improving the time to value for new Fleet users and
customers by providing instructions and tools to quickly bolster any organization's security program. 

##### Execution plan

We will focus on improving the standard query library so that it includes 80% of the most common
policies that any organization needs. In addition, we will provide documentation that makes it dead
simple to deploy on every major cloud platform (Reference architectures, AWS, GCP, Azure) as well as
open source our own internal security program. Moreover, we will eliminate fear, uncertainty and
doubt (FUD) related to the production readiness of Fleet's osquery installers.


## Product design process

The product team is responsible for product design tasks. These include drafting
changes to the Fleet product, reviewing and collecting feedback from engineering, sales, customer success, and marketing counterparts, and delivering
these changes to the engineering team.

### Drafting

* Move an issue that is assigned to you from the "Ready" column of the [üõ∏ Product team (weekly) board](https://github.com/orgs/fleetdm/projects/17) to the "In progress" column.

* Create a page in the [Fleet EE (scratchpad, dev-ready) Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/hdALBDsrti77QuDNSzLdkx/%F0%9F%9A%A7-Fleet-EE-dev-ready%2C-scratchpad?node-id=3923%3A208793) and combine your issue's number and
  title to name the Figma page.

* Draft changes to the Fleet product that solve the problem specified in the issue. Constantly place
  yourself in the shoes of a user while drafting changes. Place these drafts in the appropriate
  Figma page in Fleet EE (scratchpad, dev-ready).

* While drafting, reach out to sales, customer success, and marketing for a new perspective.

* While drafting, engage engineering to gain insight into technical costs and feasibility.

### Review

* Move the issue into the "Ready for review" column. The drafted changes that correspond to each
  issue in this column will be reviewed during the recurring product huddle meeting.

* During the product huddle meeting, record any feedback on the drafted changes.

### Deliver

* Once your work is complete and all feedback is addressed, make sure that the issue is updated with
  a link to the correct page in the Fleet EE (scratchpad) Figma. This page is where the design
  specifications live.

* Add the issue to the üèõ Architect column in [the üõ∏ Product project](https://github.com/orgs/fleetdm/projects/27). This way, an architect on the engineering team knows that the issue is ready for engineering specification and later,
  engineering estimation.

#### Priority drafting

Priority drafting is the revision of drafted changes that are currently being developed by
the engineering team. The goal of priority drafting is to quickly adapt to unknown edge cases and
changing specification while ensuring
that Fleet meets our brand and quality guidelines. 

Priority drafting occurs in the following scenarios:

* A drafted UI change is missing crucial information that prevents the engineering team from
  continuing the development task.

* Functionality included in a drafted UI change must be cut down in order to ship the improvement in
  the current scheduled release.

What happens during priority drafting?

1. Everyone on the product team and engineering team is made aware that a drafted change was brought back
   to drafting and prioritized. 

2. Drafts are updated to cover edge cases or reduce functionality.

3. UI changes are reviewed and the UI changes are brought back to the engineering team to continue
  the development task.

## Product quality

Fleet uses a human-oriented quality assurance (QA) process to ensure the product meets the standards of users and organizations.

To try Fleet locally for QA purposes, run `fleetctl preview`, which defaults to running the latest stable release.

To target a different version of Fleet, use the `--tag` flag to target any tag in [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/fleetdm/fleet/tags?page=1&ordering=last_updated), including any git commit hash or branch name.  For example, to QA the latest code on the `main` branch of fleetdm/fleet, you can run: `fleetctl preview --tag=main`

To start preview without starting the simulated hosts, use the `--no-hosts` flag (eg. `fleetctl preview --no-hosts`).

### Why human-oriented QA?

Automated tests are important, but they can't catch everything.  Many issues are hard to notice until a human looks empathetically at the user experience, whether that's in the user interface, the REST API, or the command line.

The goal of quality assurance is to catch unexpected behavior prior to release:
- bugs
- edge cases
- error message UX
- developer experience using the API/CLI
- operator experience looking at logs
- API response time latency
- UI comprehensibility
- simplicity
- data accuracy
- perceived data freshness
- the product‚Äôs ability to save users from themselves


### Collecting bugs

All QA steps should be possible using `fleetctl preview`.  Please refer to [docs/Contributing/Testing.md](https://fleetdm.com/docs/contributing/testing) for flows that cannot be completed using `fleetctl preview`.

Please start the manual QA process by creating a blank GitHub issue. As you complete each of the
flows, record a list of the bugs you encounter in this new issue. Each item in this list should
contain one sentence describing the bug and a screenshot if the item is a frontend bug.

### Fleet UI

For all following flows, please refer to the [permissions documentation](https://fleetdm.com/docs/using-fleet/permissions) to ensure that actions are limited to the appropriate user type. Any users with access beyond what this document lists as availale should be considered a bug and reported for either documentation updates or investigation.

#### Set up flow

Successfully set up `fleetctl preview` using the preview steps outlined [here](https://fleetdm.com/get-started)

#### Login and logout flow

Successfully logout and then login to your local Fleet.

#### Host details page

Select a host from the "Hosts" table as a global user with the Maintainer role. You may create a user with a fake email for this purpose.

You should be able to see and select the "Delete" button on this host's **Host details** page.

You should be able to see and select the "Query" button on this host's **Host details** page.

#### Label flow

`Flow is covered by e2e testing`

Create a new label by selecting "Add a new label" on the Hosts page. Make sure it correctly filters the host on the hosts page.

Edit this label. Confirm users can only edit the "Name" and "Description" fields for a label. Users cannot edit the "Query" field because label queries are immutable.

Delete this label.

#### Query flow

`Flow is covered by e2e testing`

Create a new saved query.

Run this query as a live query against your local machine.

Edit this query and then delete this query.

#### Pack flow

`Flow is covered by e2e testing`

Create a new pack (under Schedule/advanced).

Add a query as a saved query to the pack. Remove this query. Delete the pack.


#### My account flow

Head to the My account page by selecting the dropdown icon next to your avatar in the top navigation. Select "My account" and successfully update your password. Please do this with an extra user created for this purpose to maintain accessibility of `fleetctl preview` admin user.


### fleetctl CLI

#### Set up flow

Successfully set up Fleet by running the `fleetctl setup` command.

You may have to wipe your local MySQL database in order to successfully set up Fleet. Check out the [Clear your local MySQL database](#clear-your-local-mysql-database) section of this document for instructions.

#### Login and logout flow

Successfully login by running the `fleetctl login` command.

Successfully logout by running the `fleetctl logout` command. Then, log in again.

#### Hosts

Run the `fleetctl get hosts` command.

You should see your local machine returned. If your host isn't showing up, you may have to reenroll your local machine. Check out the [Orbit for osquery documentation](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/blob/main/orbit/README.md) for instructions on generating and installing an Orbit package.

#### Query flow

## UI design

### Communicating design changes to the engineering team
For something NEW that has been added to [Figma Fleet EE (current, dev-ready)](https://www.figma.com/file/qpdty1e2n22uZntKUZKEJl/?node-id=0%3A1):
1. Create a new [GitHub issue](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/issues/new)
2. Detail the required changes (including page links to the relevant layouts), then assign it to the __‚ÄúInitiatives‚Äù__ project.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78363703/129840932-67d55b5b-8e0e-4fb9-9300-5d458e1b91e4.png" alt="Assign to Initiatives project"/>

> ___NOTE:___ Artwork and layouts in Figma Fleet EE (current) are final assets, ready for implementation. Therefore, it‚Äôs important NOT to use the ‚Äúidea‚Äù label, as designs in this document are more than ideas - they are something that WILL be implemented._

3. Navigate to the [Initiatives project](https://github.com/orgs/fleetdm/projects/8), and hit ‚Äú+ Add cards‚Äù, pick the new issue, and drag it into the ‚Äúü§©Inspire me‚Äù column. 

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78363703/129840496-54ea4301-be20-46c2-9138-b70bff7198d0.png" alt="Add cards"/>

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78363703/129840735-3b270429-a92a-476d-87b4-86b93057b2dd.png" alt="Inspire me"/>

### Communicating unplanned design changes

For issues related to something that was ALREADY in Figma Fleet EE (current, dev-ready), but __implemented differently__, e.g, padding/spacing inconsistency etc. Create a [bug issue](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug%2C%3Areproduce&template=bug-report.md&title=) and detail the required changes.

### Design conventions

We have certain design conventions that we include in Fleet. We will document more of these over time.

**Table empty states**

Use `---`, with color `$ui-fleet-black-50` as the default UI for empty columns.

## Release 

This section outlines the communication between the product team and growth team and product team
and customer success team prior to a release of Fleet.

### Goal

Keep the business up to date with improvements and changes to the Fleet product so that all stakeholders are able to communicate
with customers and users.

### Blog post

The product team is responsible for providing the [growth team](./brand.md) with necessary information for writing
the release blog post. This is accomplished by filing a release blog post issue and adding
the issue to the growth board on GitHub.

The release blog post issue includes a list of the primary features included in the upcoming
release. This list of features should point the reader to the GitHub issue that explains each
feature in more detail.

An example release blog post issue can be found [here](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/issues/3465).

### Customer announcement

The product team is responsible for providing the [customer success team](./customers.md) with necessary information
for writing a release customer announcement. This is accomplished by filing a release customer announcement issue and adding
the issue to the customer success board on GitHub. 


The release blog post issue is filed in the private fleetdm/confidential repository because the
comment section may contain private information about Fleet's customers.

An example release customer announcement blog post issue can be found [here](https://github.com/fleetdm/confidential/issues/747).

## Feature flags

In Fleet, features are placed behind feature flags if the changes could affect Fleet's availability of existing functionalities.

The following highlights should be considered when deciding if feature flags should be leveraged:

- The feature flag must be disabled by default.
- The feature flag will not be permanent. This means that the individual who decides that a feature flag should be introduced is responsible for creating an issue to track the feature's progress towards removing the feature flag and including the feature in a stable release.
- The feature flag will not be advertised. For example, advertising in the documentation on fleetdm.com/docs, release notes, release blog posts, and Twitter.

Fleet's feature flag guidelines borrows from GitLab's ["When to use feature flags" section](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#when-to-use-feature-flags) of their handbook. Check out [GitLab's "Feature flags only when needed" video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQaGqyolOd8) for an explanation on the costs of introducing feature flags.


## Slack channels

These are the Slack channels the product team maintains. If the channel has a [directly responsible individual](./people.md#directly-resonsible-individuals) (**DRI**), they will be specified. These people are responsible for keeping up with all new messages, even if they aren't mentioned. 

- **#g-product** - **DRI**: - Noah Talerman

**Who should have these channels unmuted?** Members of this group, everyone else is encouraged to mute them.

## Competition

We track the capabilities of competitors in this [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SpAP8Y8eLa-KvkaHi5m507efSFX570EaKbrbRHM4RGs/edit#) (private).
