We embrace a spirit of iteration, understanding that we can always improve.

## Outreach one-pager

Our one-pager offers a summary of what Fleet does. It can help stakeholders become familiar with the company and product while also being a useful tool the Growth team uses for sales outreach.

## Our cold approach

At times, our sales team will reach out to prospective customers before they come to Fleet for information. Our cold approach is inspired by Daniel Grzelak’s (Founder, investor, advisor, hacker, CISO) [Linkedin post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/danielgrzelak_if-you-are-going-to-do-a-cold-approach-be-activity-6940518616459022336-iYE7?utm_source=linkedin_share&utm_medium=ios_app). The following are the keys to an engaging cold approach. Since cold approaches like these can be easily ignored as mass emails, it’s important to personalize each one. 

- Research each prospect.
- Praise what’s great about their company.
- Avoid just stating facts about our product.
- State why we would love to work with them.
- Ask questions about their company and current device management experience.
- Keep an enthusiastic and warm tone.
- Be personable.
- Ask for the meeting with a proposed time.
