# Quality

## Human-oriented QA

Fleet uses a human-oriented quality assurance (QA) process to make sure the product meets the standards of users and organizations.

Automated tests are important, but they can't catch everything. Many issues are hard to notice until a human looks empathetically at the user experience, whether in the user interface, the REST API, or the command line.

The goal of quality assurance is to catch unexpected behavior before release:
- Bugs
- Edge cases
- Error message UX
- Developer experience using the API/CLI
- Operator experience looking at logs
- API response time latency
- UI comprehensibility
- Simplicity
- Data accuracy
- Perceived data freshness
- Productâ€™s ability to save users from themselves

## Collecting bugs

To try Fleet locally for QA purposes, run `fleetctl preview`, which defaults to running the latest stable release.

To target a different version of Fleet, use the `--tag` flag to target any tag in [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/fleetdm/fleet/tags?page=1&ordering=last_updated), including any git commit hash or branch name. For example, to QA the latest code on the `main` branch of fleetdm/fleet, you can run: `fleetctl preview --tag=main`

To start preview without starting the simulated hosts, use the `--no-hosts` flag (e.g., `fleetctl preview --no-hosts`).

All QA steps should be possible using `fleetctl preview`. Please refer to [docs/Contributing/Testing-and-local-development.md](https://fleetdm.com/docs/contributing/testing) for flows that cannot be completed using `fleetctl preview`.

For each bug found, please use the (bug report template)[https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug%2C%3Areproduce&template=bug-report.md&title=] to create a new bug.
