## Customer experience

### Scheduling meetings with customers
To schedule an ad hoc meeting with a Fleet customer, use the ["Customer meeting" Calendly link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tE-NpNfw1icmU2MjYuBRib0VWBPVAdmq4NiCrpuI0F0/edit#heading=h.v47bs6uo0jpk).

### Next steps after a customer conversation
After a customer conversation, it can sometimes feel like there are 1001 things to do, but it can be hard to know where to start.  Here are some tips:

## Support process

This section outlines the customer and community support process at Fleet.

The support process is accomplished via an on-call rotation and the weekly on-call retro meeting.

The on-call engineer is responsible for responding to Slack comments, Slack threads, and GitHub issues raised by customers and the community.

The weekly on-call retro at Fleet provides time to discuss highlights and answer the following questions about the previous week's on-call:

1. What went well?

2. What could have gone better?

3. What should we remember next time?

This way, the Fleet team can constantly improve the effectiveness and experience during future on-call rotations.

### For customer requests
- Locate the appropriate issue, or create it if it doesn't already exist.  (To avoid duplication, be creative when searching GitHub for issues- it can often take a couple of tries with different keywords to find an existing issue.)
- Make sure the issue has a "customer request" label.
- Is the issue clear and easy to understand, with appropriate context?  (Default to public: declassify into public issues in fleetdm/fleet whenever possible)
- Is there a key date or timeframe that the customer is hoping to meet?  If so, please post about that in #g-product with a link to the issue, so the team can discuss before committing to a time frame.
- Have we provided a link to that issue for the customer to remind everyone of the plan, and for the sake of visibility, so other folks who weren't directly involved are up to speed?  (e.g. "Hi everyone, here's a link to the issue we discussed on today's call: […link…](https://omfgdogs.com)")

## Generating a trial license key
Fleet's self-service license dispenser (coming soon) is the best way to generate trial license keys for Fleet Premium.

In the meantime, to generate a trial license key, [create an opportunity issue](https://github.com/fleetdm/confidential/issues/new/choose) for the customer and follow the instructions in the issue for generating a trial license key.
