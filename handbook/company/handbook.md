## Contributing to the handbook

To contribute to a handbook page:

All done! 

### Adding a new handbook page

To contribute a new handbook page:
1. Determine where the new page should live in the handbook.  That is, nested under either:
  a. [the "Company" handbook](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company), or
  b. the handbook for a particular division (Security, Engineering, Product, Sales, Marketing, Business Operations)
2. Locate the appropriate folder for the new page in [the GitHub repository under `handbook/`](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/tree/main/handbook).
3. Create a new markdown file (like [one of these](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/tree/f90148abad96fccb6c5647a31877fa7e91b5ee57/handbook/digital-experience)).  A simple, easy way to do this is by clicking "Add file" on GitHub.com.
  a. Name your new file the kebab-cased, all lowercase version of your page title, with `.md` at the end.  (For example, a page titled "Why this way?" would have the file path: `handbook/company/why-this-way.md`.)
  b. At the top of your new page, include an H1 (`# Page title here`) with the same name as your page.
  c. At the bottom of your new page, include the appropriate `meta` tag to indicate the page maintainer.  (This is usually the same person who is the maintainer of the top-level page.  The easiest way to do this is to copy the tags from the bottom of the top-level page and paste them in to your new page, changing their values to suit, as-needed.)
4. Submit your change, requesting review from the maintainer of the top-level page.

> Note: GitHub _should_ automatically request review from the right person when submitting your merge request, thanks to CODEOWNERS.  Configuration for the auto-approval bot should also be taken care of automatically, so there's no further action needed from you.)
