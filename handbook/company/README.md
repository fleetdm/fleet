# Company

## Purpose

Fleet is an [open-core company](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/why-this-way#why-open-source) that sells subscriptions that offer [more features and support](https://fleetdm.com/pricing) for Fleet and osquery, the leading open-source systems management platform and security agent. Today, Fleet enrolls millions of laptops and servers, and it is especially popular with [enterprise IT and security teams](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7120880290859728897/).

Fleet is dedicated to a comprehensive strategy against [whatever this is](https://chat.openai.com/share/e44ba6f3-b3ed-488a-a15e-a5a723f20c98): 

- 🔌 making security and IT interoperable and easy to automate with open standards and data.
- 🚪 creating an inviting (outsider-friendly) way to manage computers, CVEs, and infrastructure.
- 🪟 building clarity and trust through open-source software.

This is the guiding purpose behind Fleet's [product strategy](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/communications#strategy), [operating principles](#why-this-way), and [brand](https://fleetdm.com/logos).

<!--
With great power
comes great openness
With agents comes agency
Lighter than air
Light in every corner
Open by design

## Culture

### All remote
Fleet Device Management Inc. is an all-remote company with 40+ team members spread across four continents and nine time zones.  The broader team of contributors [worldwide](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/graphs/contributors) submits patches, bug reports, troubleshooting tips, improvements, and real-world insights to Fleet's open-source code base, documentation, website, and [company handbook](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/why-this-way#why-handbook-first-strategy).

### Open source
Fleet is open by design.  The majority of the code, documentation, and content we create at Fleet is public and [source-available](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/why-this-way#why-open-source).  The Fleet handbook is the central guide for how we run the company, and even it is open to the world.  We [strive to be open](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company#openness) and transparent in the way we run the business, as much as [confidentiality](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/communications#levels-of-confidentiality) agreements (and time) allow. We perform better with an audience, and our audience performs better with us.

### Why this way?
At Fleet, we write things down.  Even when we might be wrong.  This helps us move quickly, provides clarity, and enables asynchronous work.  The "Why this way?" page in the handbook discusses some of our most important decisions about the best way to work and the reasoning for them.  For example: _"Why open source?"_, _"Why do we use a wireframe-first approach?"_, _"Why direct responsibility?_, and _"Why handbook-first strategy?"_  You can read more about these principles and suggest improvements in ["📖Company/Why this way?"](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/why-this-way)

## Values

Fleet's values are a set of five ideals adopted by everyone on the team. They describe the shared mindset we are working together to create, inside and outside the company: [🔴 Empathy](#empathy), [🟠 Ownership](#ownership), [🟢 Results](#results), [🔵 Objectivity](#objectivity), and [🟣 Openness](#openness).

Values play an important role in hiring, performance management, and compensation decisions.  When a new team member joins the company, they adopt our values, from day one.

This way, everybody knows what to expect from the people they work with.


### 🔴 Empathy
Empathy leads to smarter decisions.  Take an interest in what people are going through, so you can help make it better.

- **Assume positive intent.** Think and say [positive things](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2018/06/mr-rogers-neighborhood-talking-to-kids/562352/), and [assume](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#assume-positive-intent) others are doing the same.  Keep it light.
- **Be a helper.** Take care of customers first. But give hospitality and [service with a smile](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Rogers#Legacy) to everyone you can.
- **Read what you write.**  [Shorten](http://www.paulgraham.com/writing44.html) it. [Repeat](http://www.paulgraham.com/useful.html). <!-- Read it again, in context. Read it out loud.  Role play. Put yourself in the reader’s shoes.  Be clear and interesting. Write stuff worth reading.   Is ALL of it worth reading?  Roleplay. Use your imagination to see situations from different perspectives. -->
- **Get curious.**  Wonder about things. Notice. Ask people genuine questions, and listen closely.

### 🟠 Ownership
It takes a fully-activated mind to achieve ambitious goals, and remote work requires self-discipline.  Think like an owner of the company.

- **Be reliable.**  Reply quickly to email, Slack, and GitHub.  Prepare for meetings.  Arrive [on time](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/communications#meetings).  Use handbooked [processes](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/leadership/#process-gets-a-bad-rep) and [decisions](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/why-this-way#why-this-way).
- **Finish what you start.** Follow through on commitments.  Take responsibility for mistakes.  There's no time for finger-pointing.  [Just fix it](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#bias-for-action).
- **No one is coming.** Take care of [things that need doing](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/communications#spending-company-money), or loop in [the right people](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/why-this-way#why-direct-responsibility) fast. It's up to you.  <!-- take initiative -->
- **Think long term.** Contribute to [the big picture](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company#purpose), beyond your department's goals. Reduce maintenance.  Beware the thicket.  <!-- Think [7 years ahead](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company#strategy). -->

### 🟢 Results
We work to get results. How we work determines what we get.  Aim to deliver results daily.

- **Iterate.** [Look for ways](https://youtu.be/BW6TWwNZzIQ) to make [smaller changes](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/product-principles/#the-minimal-viable-change-mvc), more often.  Always publish. <!-- Resist [gold plating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_plating_(project_management)). -->
- **Start quickly.** Be 70% sure.  Resist [bike-shedding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality).  Between overthinking and rushing, there is a [golden mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_mean_%28philosophy%29). <!-- [Satisfice](https://longform.asmartbear.com/maximizing) before optimizing. -->
- **Keep it simple.** [Spend less](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/why-this-way#why-spend-less). Avoid preemptive structure.  Choose ["boring solutions"](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2020/08/18/boring-solutions-faster-iteration/). Reuse systems. Avoid adding steps, especially handoffs. <!-- Be efficient. Avoid creating multiple ways to do the same thing.  Practicality over sophistication. -->
- **Be realistic.** Focus on one or two tasks at a time.  When you can't take on [more work](http://www.paulgraham.com/hwh.html), clarify your boundaries.  Schedule [time off](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/communications#paid-time-off) to recharge. <!-- Practice self-care. -->

### 🔵 Objectivity
To reach our goals, we need to [see reality clearly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_honesty).

- **Find the bottleneck.** When something isn't working, look for the worst part. 
 [Fix that first](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_constraints).
- **Change your mind.**  [Be willing to reconsider](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#articulate-when-you-change-your-mind) in the face of new evidence. Escape the [sunk cost fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost).
- **Be rigorous.** A lucky streak can do more harm than good.  Understand why it works first.  Change one variable at a time. <!--  Certainty is overrated. Be a skeptic. Cultivate doubt. Interrogate luck. Check your assumptions.  “Fixes” are fleeting.  Don't say "just do XYZ".  Use [the scientific method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_research). The road to failure is paved with ["happy paths"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_path). -->
- **Think for yourself.** Remember how often [conventional wisdom](http://www.paulgraham.com/think.html) isn't.  <!-- Use first principles thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ab_initio#Science_and_engineering) -->

### 🟣 Openness
Take the time to make [yourself](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/communications#meetings) and [your work](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/why-this-way#why-make-work-visible) visible.  This also takes courage.

- **Write it down.** Let people [find](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#findability) and [reproduce](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#reproducibility) your [decisions](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/why-this-way#why-handbook-first-strategy).  Remove outdated content so your writing is trustworthy, and [write simply](http://www.paulgraham.com/simply.html) so it is outsider friendly.
- **Have short toes.** Everyone can contribute.  Get comfortable with [others contributing to your work](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#short-toes).
- **Public by default.** Everything we do is [public by default](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/why-this-way#why-open-source). Redact [non-public info](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/communications#levels-of-confidentiality) carefully.
- **Speak freely.** Interrupt and be interrupted.  Give pointed and respectful feedback, even [when you disagree](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/why-this-way#why-this-way).

### 🪩 Dumb luck

Ever wonder why there are 6 circles in the Fleet logo, but only 5 values?  Behold, the sixth value: dumb luck.

## History

### 2014: Origins of osquery
In 2014, our cofounder Zach Wasserman, together with [Mike Arpaia](https://twitter.com/mikearpaia/status/1357455391588839424) and the rest of their team at Facebook, created an open source project called [osquery](https://osquery.io).

### 2016: Origins of Fleet v1.0
A few years later, Zach, Mike Arpaia, and [Jason Meller](https://honest.security) founded [Kolide](https://kolide.com) and created Fleet: an open source platform that made it easier and more productive to use osquery in an enterprise setting.

### 2019: The growing community
When Kolide's attention shifted away from Fleet, and towards their separate, user-focused SaaS offering, the Fleet community [took over maintenance](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press/press-release/the-linux-foundation-announces-intent-to-form-new-foundation-to-support-osquery-community) of the open-source project. After his time at Kolide, Zach continued as lead maintainer of Fleet.  He spent 2019 consulting and working with the growing open source community to support and extend the capabilities of the Fleet platform.

### 2020: Fleet was incorporated
Zach partnered with our [CEO, Mike McNeil](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/leadership#ceo-flaws), to found a new, independent company: Fleet Device Management Inc.  In November 2020, we [announced](https://medium.com/fleetdm/a-new-fleet-d4096c7de978) the transition and kicked off the logistics of moving the GitHub repository.

### 2022: Millions of hosts
Fleet raised its Series A funding round.  The world now has at least 1.65 million computers and virtual hosts enrolled in Fleet, including enterprises, governments, startups, families, and hobbyist racks all over the world.

### 2023: Your last MDM migration
Fleet added support for [scripting and management capabilities](https://fleetdm.com/announcements/fleet-introduces-windows-mdm) on macOS, Windows, _and_ Linux devices, allowing IT departments to manage devices more consistently using modern tooling and best practices.  This allowed many customers to simplify their management practices.  In several cases, Fleet was also able to save customers several hundreds of thousands of dollars (USD) by cutting tool overlap across platforms such as Jamf, Airwatch, Intune, MobileIron, Nexthink, Tanium, Uptycs, and Rapid7.
