# Company

## Purpose

Fleet Device Management Inc is an [open-core company](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/why-this-way#why-this-way) that sells subscriptions that offer [more features and support](https://fleetdm.com/pricing) for Fleet and osquery, the leading open-source security agent.  Today, Fleet enrolls millions of laptops and servers, and it is especially popular with [enterprise IT and security teams](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press/press-release/the-linux-foundation-announces-intent-to-form-new-foundation-to-support-osquery-community).

We are dedicated to:

- üßë‚ÄçüöÄ automating IT and security with a living, breathing API.
- ü™ü privacy, transparency, and trust through open source software.
- üíª a better way to manage computers.


## Culture

### All remote
Fleet Device Management Inc. is an all-remote company with 30+ team members spread across four continents and eight time zones.  The broader team of contributors [worldwide](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/graphs/contributors) submits patches, bug reports, troubleshooting tips, improvements, and real-world insights to Fleet's open-source code base, documentation, website, and [company handbook](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/why-this-way#why-handbook-first-strategy).

### Open source
The majority of the code, documentation, and content we create at Fleet is public and [source-available](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/why-this-way#why-open-source).  The Fleet handbook is the central guide for how we run the company, and even it is open to the world.  We [strive to be open](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company#openness) and transparent in the way we run the business, as much as [confidentiality](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company#levels-of-confidentiality) agreements (and time) allow. We perform better with an audience, and our audience performs better with us.


## Why this way?
At Fleet, we write things down.  Even when we might be wrong.  This helps us move quickly, provides clarity, and enables asynchronous work.  The "Why this way?" page in the handbook discusses some of our most important decisions about the best way to work and the reasoning for them.  For example: _"Why open source?"_, _"Why do we use a wireframe-first approach?"_, _"Why direct responsibility?_, and _"Why handbook-first strategy?"_  You can read more about these principles and suggest improvements in ["Why this way?"](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/why-this-way)

### Is it any good?

Here are a few reasons to work at Fleet:
- Work from anywhere with good internet. (We're 100% remote. No office. No commute.) Everyone works remote, but you don't feel remote. There is no 'headquarters'. You are free to travel and move.
- Fleet can offer you a competitive salary, significant equity, and an independent, outsider-friendly culture. Work with helpful, kind, and motivated people who know what they're doing.
- At Fleet, we value focus, iteration, and meaningful results ‚Äì not 60 hour work weeks. We are non-judgmental and laser-focused on growing the company.
- Work closely with experienced, well-funded founders and a great team, including the people who created osquery and Sails. We care about openness and transparency.
- Work computers can be private and safe. Help make endpoint monitoring less intrusive and more transparent.
- Protect the production servers and employee laptops of Earth's largest companies. Work on a product used by lots of people who care about what you do.
- Fleet is growing quickly, with significant revenue from Fortune 1000 customers. You will have lots of opportunities to make decisions, learn, and try new things.


## Values

Fleet's values are a set of five ideals adopted by everyone on the team. They describe the culture we are working together to deliver, inside and outside the company: üî¥ Empathy, üü† Ownership, üü¢ Results, üîµ Objectivity, and üü£ Openness.

Values play an important role in hiring, performance management, and compensation decisions. When a new team member joins Fleet, they adopt the values, from day one.  This way, even as the company grows, everybody knows what to expect from the people they work with.  Having a shared mindset keeps us quick and determined.

### üî¥ Empathy
Empathy leads to better understanding, better communication, and better decisions.  Try to understand what people may be going through, so you can help make it better.

- **Be considerate.** Keep the needs of customers, contributors, and colleagues in mind. Treat others the way you‚Äôd like to be treated.
- **Be curious.** Ask questions. Try seeing situations from different perspectives. Use your imagination to find understanding.
- **Remember the user.** Prioritize product quality. Create patches with care. Fix bugs quickly. Take time writing error messages.
- **Invest in hospitality.** Apply customer service principles to all users. Be generous with your time. Think and say [positive things](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2018/06/mr-rogers-neighborhood-talking-to-kids/562352/).

### üü† Ownership
Achieving ambitious goals requires reliability and initiative. That‚Äôs why we encourage every Fleetie to think like an owner. Your impact goes beyond the responsibilities of your role.

- **Be accountable.** Follow through on commitments. Own up to mistakes. Understand how your work furthers Fleet‚Äôs goals.
- **Be responsive.** Respond quickly whether or not you can take immediate action. Offer feedback freely (even if you disagree).
- **Think bigger.** Remember the big picture beyond your team's goals. Consider how Fleet creates value for customers.
- **Take initiative.** You don't need permission to be thoughtful. Think for yourself (from first principles). Great ideas come from everyone.

### üü¢ Results
We work to get results. How we work determines the results we deliver. Between overthinking and rushing, there's a [golden mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_mean_%28philosophy%29). We balance speed and sustainability to build high-quality products.

- **[Iterate](https://youtu.be/BW6TWwNZzIQ) your work.** Look for ways to make frequent, small changes. Get perspective on complex problems. There may be a simpler solution.
- **Move quickly.** Aim to deliver results daily. "Everything is in draft." Resist gold-plating and avoid [bike-shedding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality).
- **Be efficient.** Focus on fewer tasks at one time. Use fewer words when possible. Go with "boring solutions." Keep things simple.
- **Practice self-care.** Remember to take breaks. Schedule time off to recharge. Organize your workday to fit your lifestyle.

### üîµ Objectivity
Our objective as a company is to make money. This is how we measure success. Customers pay for products that make a difference. Approach every project with this in mind.

- **Be humble.** Seek feedback and understanding. Remember, it‚Äôs rare to get things right the first time. Question yourself.
- **Underpromise and overdeliver.** Be practical about what's possible. But don‚Äôt settle for the ‚Äúhappy path‚Äù right away.
- **Prioritize the truth.** Feel free to change your mind in the face of new evidence. Avoid the sunk cost fallacy. Give credit where credit is due.
- **Be rigorous.** A lucky fix without understanding does more harm than good. When something isn't working, use the scientific method.

### üü£ Openness
Openness leads to better products and stronger partnerships. Being open about your work isn‚Äôt always easy. But practicing this skill will help you throughout your career.

- **Welcome contributions.** Be friendly, inclusive, and approachable. Get comfortable letting others contribute to your domain.
- **Embrace candor.** Be positive and assume positive intent. Don‚Äôt be afraid to speak up. Give pointed and respectful feedback. 
- **Write everything down.** Let people learn about your work. Use simple language. Avoid acronyms and idioms that might not translate.
- **Be transparent.** We build in the open. Everything we do is [public by default](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/why-this-way#why-open-source). Declassify confidential information with care. 


## History

### 2014: Origins of osquery
In 2014, our CTO Zach Wasserman, together with [Mike Arpaia](https://twitter.com/mikearpaia/status/1357455391588839424) and the rest of their team at Facebook, created an open source project called [osquery](https://osquery.io).

### 2016: Origins of Fleet v1.0
A few years later, Zach, Mike Arpaia, and [Jason Meller](https://honest.security) founded [Kolide](https://kolide.com) and created Fleet: an open source platform that made it easier and more productive to use osquery in an enterprise setting.

### 2019: The growing community
When Kolide's attention shifted away from Fleet, and towards their separate, user-focused SaaS offering, the Fleet community took over maintenance of the open source project. After his time at Kolide, Zach continued as lead maintainer of Fleet.  He spent 2019 consulting and working with the growing open source community to support and extend the capabilities of the Fleet platform.

### 2020: Fleet was incorporated
Zach partnered with our CEO, Mike McNeil, to found a new, independent company: Fleet Device Management Inc.  In November 2020, we [announced](https://medium.com/fleetdm/a-new-fleet-d4096c7de978) the transition and kicked off the logistics of moving the GitHub repository.

### 2022: Millions of hosts
Fleet raised its Series A funding round.  The world now has at least 1.65 million computers and virtual hosts enrolled in Fleet, including enterprises, governments, startups, families, and hobbyist racks all over the world.


## Org chart
To provide clarity about decision-making, responsibility, and resources, everyone at Fleet has a manager, and every manager has direct reports.  Fleet's organizational chart is accessible company-wide as a sub-tab in ["üßë‚ÄçüöÄ Fleeties" (private google doc)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OSLn-ZCbGSjPusHPiR5dwQhheH1K8-xqyZdsOe9y7qc/edit#gid=0).  On the other sub-tabs, you can also check out a world map of where everyone is located, hiring stats, and fun facts about each team member.

## Product groups
Above and beyond the organizational chart, Fleet organizes cross-functional groups focused on particular business goals.  This helps¬†product development teams move more quickly by eliminating roundtrips spent waiting for feedback and answers from people in other departments. Product groups include a designer, a product quality lead, developers, a product manager, and an engineering manager.  For more information, check out the ["Product groups"](./development-groups.md) page.

## Advisors
While most improvements at Fleet are driven by informal conversations with customers and open-source contributors, the company also has a few dozen advisors and investors, including
[Sid](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2022/10/14/one-third-of-what-we-learned-about-ipos-in-taking-gitlab-public/) [Sijbrandij](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/ceo/#sijbrandij-pronunciation-hint) _(GitLab)_, [Dylan Field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dylan_Field) _(Figma)_, [Jack Naglieri](https://councils.forbes.com/profile/Jack-Naglieri-Founder-CEO-Panther/a5f3a285-e983-4f4c-9f9d-2f0d4335f00d) _(Panther Labs)_, [Mike Arpaia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfCak2UIOD8) _(osquery)_, and [other smart people who are eager to help](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15knBE2-PrQ1Ad-QcIk0mxCN-xFsATKK9hcifqrm0qFQ/edit).  If you have a question for one of them, Fleet's CEO is happy to introduce you.  (Just ask.)
