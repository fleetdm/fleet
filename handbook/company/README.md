# Company

## Purpose

Fleet Device Management Inc is an [open-core company](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/why-this-way#why-open-source) that sells subscriptions that offer [more features and support](https://fleetdm.com/pricing) for Fleet and osquery, the leading open-source security agent.  Today, Fleet enrolls millions of laptops and servers, and it is especially popular with [enterprise IT and security teams](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press/press-release/the-linux-foundation-announces-intent-to-form-new-foundation-to-support-osquery-community).

We are dedicated to:

- 🧑‍🚀 automating IT and security with a living, breathing API.
- 🪟 privacy, transparency, and trust through open-source software.
- 💻 a better way to manage computers.


## Culture

### All remote
Fleet Device Management Inc. is an all-remote company with 30+ team members spread across four continents and eight time zones.  The broader team of contributors [worldwide](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/graphs/contributors) submits patches, bug reports, troubleshooting tips, improvements, and real-world insights to Fleet's open-source code base, documentation, website, and [company handbook](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/why-this-way#why-handbook-first-strategy).

### Open source
The majority of the code, documentation, and content we create at Fleet is public and [source-available](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/why-this-way#why-open-source).  The Fleet handbook is the central guide for how we run the company, and even it is open to the world.  We [strive to be open](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company#openness) and transparent in the way we run the business, as much as [confidentiality](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company#levels-of-confidentiality) agreements (and time) allow. We perform better with an audience, and our audience performs better with us.


## Why this way?
At Fleet, we write things down.  Even when we might be wrong.  This helps us move quickly, provides clarity, and enables asynchronous work.  The "Why this way?" page in the handbook discusses some of our most important decisions about the best way to work and the reasoning for them.  For example: _"Why open source?"_, _"Why do we use a wireframe-first approach?"_, _"Why direct responsibility?_, and _"Why handbook-first strategy?"_  You can read more about these principles and suggest improvements in ["📖Company/Why this way?"](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/why-this-way)

- Fleet is growing quickly, with significant revenue from Fortune 1000 customers. You will have lots of opportunities to make decisions, learn, and try new things.


## Values

Fleet's values are a set of five ideals adopted by everyone on the team. They describe the shared mindset we are working together to create, inside and outside the company: [🔴 Empathy](#empathy), [🟠 Ownership](#ownership), [🟢 Results](#results), [🔵 Objectivity](#objectivity), and [🟣 Openness](#openness).

Values play an important role in hiring, performance management, and compensation decisions.  When a new team member joins the company, they adopt our values, from day one.

This way, everybody knows what to expect from the people they work with.


### 🔴 Empathy
Empathy leads to smarter decisions.  Take an interest in what people are going through, so you can help make it better.

- **Assume positive intent.** Think and say [positive things](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2018/06/mr-rogers-neighborhood-talking-to-kids/562352/), and [assume](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#assume-positive-intent) others are doing the same.
- **Be a helper.** Take care of customers first. But give hospitality and [service with a smile](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Rogers#Legacy) to everyone you can.
- **Roleplay.** Read what you write.  [Again.](http://www.paulgraham.com/useful.html)  Use your imagination to see situations from different perspectives.
- **Get curious.** Genuinely care. Ask questions. Listen closely to the answers. Be present.

### 🟠 Ownership
It takes reliable execution and a fully-activated mind to achieve ambitious goals. Think like an owner of the company.

- **Be responsive.** Reply quickly, consistently, whether or not you can take immediate action. Especially merge requests, Slack, and emails.
- **Assume responsibility.** Own up to mistakes. There's no time for finger-pointing, just fix it.  Follow through on commitments quickly.
- **No one is coming.** Take initiative. Take care of [things that need doing](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/business-operations#spending-company-money), or loop in [the right people](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/why-this-way#why-direct-responsibility) fast. Understand [Fleet's goals](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company#purpose) yourself. Look for [bottlenecks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_constraints).
- **Think long term.** Remember [the big picture](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company#purpose) beyond your department's goals.

### 🟢 Results
We work to get results. How we work determines what we get.  Aim to deliver results daily.

- **Iterate.** [Look for ways](https://youtu.be/BW6TWwNZzIQ) to make smaller changes, more often.  Always be cutting scope.  But finish what you bite off.
- **Move quickly.** Resist [gold plating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_plating_(project_management)) and [bike-shedding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality).  Between overthinking and rushing, there is a [golden mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_mean_%28philosophy%29).
- **Keep things simple.** Focus on fewer tasks. Choose ["boring solutions"](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2020/08/18/boring-solutions-faster-iteration/). Use [fewer words](http://www.paulgraham.com/writing44.html). Avoid preemptive structure.
- **Be realistic.** When you can't take on [more work](http://www.paulgraham.com/hwh.html), clarify your boundaries.  Schedule [time off](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/business-operations#taking-time-off) to recharge.  Practice self-care.

### 🔵 Objectivity
To reach our goals, we need to see reality clearly.

- **Be humble.** When something isn't working, stop assuming.  Use [the scientific method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_research). <!-- and [first principles thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ab_initio#Science_and_engineering). -->
- **Seek the truth.** [Change your mind](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company#why-this-way) in the face of new evidence. Escape the [sunk cost fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost).
- **Interrogate luck.** Understand why it's broken first. A lucky fix can do more harm than good. <!--  Don't say "just do XYZ". The road to failure is paved with ["happy paths"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_path). -->
- **Think for yourself.** Remember how often [conventional wisdom](http://www.paulgraham.com/think.html) isn't.

### 🟣 Openness
Take the time to make [yourself](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/business-operations#meetings) and [your work](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/why-this-way#why-make-work-visible) visible.  This also takes courage.

- **Write it down.** Let people learn about your [decisions](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/why-this-way#why-handbook-first-strategy).  Remove outdated content so your writing is trustworthy, and [write simply](http://www.paulgraham.com/simply.html) so it is outsider friendly.
- **Everyone can contribute.** Have [short toes](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#short-toes). Get comfortable letting others contribute to your domain.
- **Be transparent.** Everything we do is [public by default](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/why-this-way#why-open-source). Redact [non-public info](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/business-operations#levels-of-confidentiality) carefully.
- **[Commit](https://www.audible.com/pd/The-15-Commitments-of-Conscious-Leadership-Audiobook/B00SKV11H2) to candor.** Give pointed and respectful feedback, even [when you disagree](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/why-this-way#why-this-way).  Interrupt and be interrupted.


## History

### 2014: Origins of osquery
In 2014, our CTO Zach Wasserman, together with [Mike Arpaia](https://twitter.com/mikearpaia/status/1357455391588839424) and the rest of their team at Facebook, created an open source project called [osquery](https://osquery.io).

### 2016: Origins of Fleet v1.0
A few years later, Zach, Mike Arpaia, and [Jason Meller](https://honest.security) founded [Kolide](https://kolide.com) and created Fleet: an open source platform that made it easier and more productive to use osquery in an enterprise setting.

### 2019: The growing community
When Kolide's attention shifted away from Fleet, and towards their separate, user-focused SaaS offering, the Fleet community took over maintenance of the open source project. After his time at Kolide, Zach continued as lead maintainer of Fleet.  He spent 2019 consulting and working with the growing open source community to support and extend the capabilities of the Fleet platform.

### 2020: Fleet was incorporated
Zach partnered with our CEO, Mike McNeil, to found a new, independent company: Fleet Device Management Inc.  In November 2020, we [announced](https://medium.com/fleetdm/a-new-fleet-d4096c7de978) the transition and kicked off the logistics of moving the GitHub repository.

### 2022: Millions of hosts
Fleet raised its Series A funding round.  The world now has at least 1.65 million computers and virtual hosts enrolled in Fleet, including enterprises, governments, startups, families, and hobbyist racks all over the world.

## Org chart
To provide clarity about decision-making, [responsibility](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/why-this-way#why-direct-responsibility), and resources, everyone at Fleet has a manager, and every manager has direct reports.  Fleet's organizational chart is accessible company-wide as a sub-tab in ["🧑‍🚀 Fleeties" (private google doc)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OSLn-ZCbGSjPusHPiR5dwQhheH1K8-xqyZdsOe9y7qc/edit#gid=0).  On the other sub-tabs, you can also check out a world map of where everyone is located, hiring stats, and fun facts about each team member.

## Product groups
Above and beyond the organizational chart, Fleet organizes cross-functional groups focused on particular business goals.  This helps product development teams move more quickly by eliminating roundtrips spent waiting for feedback and answers from people in other departments. Product groups include a designer, a product quality lead, developers, a product manager, and an engineering manager.  For more information, check out the ["Product groups"](./development-groups.md) page.

## Advisors
While most improvements at Fleet are driven by informal conversations with customers and open-source contributors, the company also has a few dozen advisors and investors, including
[Sid](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2022/10/14/one-third-of-what-we-learned-about-ipos-in-taking-gitlab-public/) [Sijbrandij](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/ceo/#sijbrandij-pronunciation-hint) _(GitLab)_, [Dylan Field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dylan_Field) _(Figma)_, [Jack Naglieri](https://councils.forbes.com/profile/Jack-Naglieri-Founder-CEO-Panther/a5f3a285-e983-4f4c-9f9d-2f0d4335f00d) _(Panther Labs)_, [Mike Arpaia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfCak2UIOD8) _(osquery)_, and [other smart people who are eager to help](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15knBE2-PrQ1Ad-QcIk0mxCN-xFsATKK9hcifqrm0qFQ/edit).  If you have a question for one of them, Fleet's CEO is happy to introduce you.  (Just ask.)
