# Communication

## Meetings
* Plan to join meetings on time. At Fleet, we start on time and do not wait for folks to join.  As most of our meetings are conducted over zoom, please join with a working microphone and with your camera on whenever possible.  Being even a few minutes late can make a big difference and slow your meeting counterparts down. When in doubt, show up a couple of minutes early. 
* It's okay to spend the first minute or two of a meeting being present and making small talk. Since we are all remote, it's easy to miss out on hallway chatter and human connections that happen in [meatspace](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/meatspace).  Use this time together during the first minute to say "Hi!"  Then you can jump into the topics to be discussed.
* Turning on your camera allows for more complete and intuitive verbal and non-verbal communication. Feel free to leave your camera on or turn it off when joining meetings with new participants you might not be familiar with yet. Turn your camera on when you lead or cohost a meeting.
* In an all-remote company, ‚Äúface time‚Äù matters. Remember: even if someone‚Äôs calendar is open, they have other work to do. Limiting (or batching up) internal meetings can enable longer, uninterrupted stretches of deep work.

### Scheduling a meeting
We use Zoom for all meetings.  The only exceptions are meetings with customers who are non-negotiably required to use a different tool.

We use the Zoom add-on for Google Calendar to schedule Zoom meetings when we create calendar events. To add a Zoom meeting to a calendar event, click the "Add video conferencing" dropdown and select "Zoom Meeting." Google Calendar will automatically add the Zoom meeting details and instructions to join the event.

We configure our Zoom meetings to let participants join before the host starts the meeting. We do this to make sure meetings start on time, even if the host isn't there.

#### Internal meeting scheduling
Use the Google Calendar "[Find a meeting time](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/72143?hl=en&ref_topic=10510646&sjid=7187599067132459840-NA#zippy=%2Cclick-an-empty-time-in-your-calendar)" feature to coordinate meetings with Fleet team members. 
Enter the `@fleetdm.com` emails for each participant into the "Meet with..." box in Google Calendar, and the calendar availability for each participant will appear in your view. Then, when you select a meeting time, those participants will automatically be invited, and a video conference will be attached to the invite.
Please prefer this strategy over negotiating meeting times via chat -- This can save a lot of communication overhead, especially when scheduling with multiple participants.
It is important to [set your workinghours](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/7638168?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop) in Google Calendar and block out any personal time/events/PTO, so that team members do not inadvertently schedule a time when you are not available. 
Many team members use the free tier of [reclaim.ai](https://reclaim.ai/) to synchronize personal event times (without event details) into their work calendars. 
It is also common practice to block out time for focused work.

##### Modifying an event organized by someone else
To edit an event where someone else at Fleet is the organizer, you can first subscribe to their calendar in Google Calendar and then edit the event on their calendar.  Your edits will automatically apply to all attendees.
This works because every Fleetie grants edit access to everyone else at Fleet as part of onboarding.

#### External meeting scheduling
When scheduling external meetings, provide external participants with a
[Calendly](https://calendly.com) link to schedule with the relevant internal participants. If you
need a Calendly account, reach out to `mikermcneil` via Slack.
