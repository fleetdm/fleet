As Product Designer at Fleet, you will get the chance to…

In your first 90 days:

- ⏫ Engage with product management, engineering, business stakeholders, and customers to understand initiatives
- 📣 Design consistent interactions across the Fleet user experience, including API and CLI
- 🌡️ Drive the refinement process from concept to high fidelity prototypes


### Are you our new team member? 🧑‍🚀

- 📖 Maintain a design system that enables speed for designers, PMs, and engineers
- 🧑‍🔬 Develop an understanding of developer-first automation workflows, including API and CLI experiences

- 📈 Prototype-first: You embrace speed and failure as we iterate towards the right solution. You have hands-on experience in creating low and high fidelity prototypes. You’re comfortable accepting suboptimal designs in favor of iteration.
- 🧬 Simplicity: You love complex questions and use your work to simplify that complexity for users.
- 🟣 Openness: You are flexible and open to new ideas and ways of working
- ➕ Bonus: cybersecurity or IT background
