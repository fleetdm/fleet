You may find that a DoS (High Availability Impact) not as relevant for you, or equally a vulnerability requiring user interaction has a very low likelihood of exploit in another scenario.  If you want to fine tune your SSVC, it worth using the vectors you care about instead of the score itself. But ultimately you would want to read the description of the vulnerabilities to determine the risk they are posing to your environment. SSVC can assist you to do that in a more efficient way.'

    - description: 'Melissa Bischoping: CVSS is never enough to contextualize the urgency or risk of a vulnerability in your environment. It is one metric that needs to be part of an overall risk calculus, but a CVSS of 6 can be a greater threat in your organization than a CVSS of 10 based on the environmental variables and mitigations. Only two 10.0s here, but several lower severity that are resulting in high-impact breaches.   Getting a handle on managing that public facing infrastructure and being able to rapidly patch the apps and devices with such exposure needs to be part of an overall plan, but must go hand in hand with mitigations and layers of a zero trust design. CVSS isn’t the sole determination of risk, it’s only one partial piece of data to understand the impact of a vulnerability if exploited.'

      quote: In reality, across our inventory of devices, it's unlikely to ever be exploited. I'd rather do that legwork on my team and then go and ask and prioritize work on these infrastructure teams that are already busy with things that could or could not be vulnerable. Being able to be more exact allows us to go to these teams less, which saves everybody time.
