      quote: In reality, across our inventory of devices, it's unlikely to ever be exploited. I'd rather do that legwork on my team and then go and ask and prioritize work on these infrastructure teams that are already busy with things that could or could not be vulnerable. Being able to be more exact allows us to go to these teams less, which saves everybody time.
