# ü¶Ñ Go-To-Market groups

This page covers the journey from prospect to customer and details what contributors need to know in order to make changes to the Go-To-Market (GTM) [philosophy](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/why-this-way#why-dont-we-sell-like-everyone-else), [strategy](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/go-to-market-groups#gtm-strategy), and [actions](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/go-to-market-groups#warm-up-actions) at Fleet.


## Why cross-functional GTM groups?

When communicating with future or current customers, hand offs [between departments](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company#org-chart), contributors, or external organizations can negatively effect the "Return On Investment" (ROI) for Fleet, our customers, and our friends in the community. Cross-functional GTM groups minimize hand offs between internal and external stakeholders and maximize iteration and efficiency in the way we engage with the market.


> - Use this "ü¶Ñ Go-To-Market groups" page to write down philosophies and show how the different pieces of the GTM process fit together.
> - Use the dedicated departmental handbook pages for [ü´ß Marketing](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/marketing), [üåê Digital Experience](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/digital-experience), [üêã Sales](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/sales), [üå¶Ô∏è Customer Success](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/customer-success), and [üí∏ Finance](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/finance) to keep track of specific responsibilities and recurring rituals designed to be read and used within those departments.

### Competition

> Due to legislation by the U.S. Department of Commerce, we are unable to initiate business with [certain countries and territories including specific U.S. sanction programs.](https://ofac.treasury.gov/sanctions-programs-and-country-information)




## GTM outreach 

Go-To-Market (GTM) strategy at Fleet is [always evolving](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#everything-is-in-draft), but the [philosophy behind the strategy](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/why-this-way#why-dont-we-sell-like-everyone-else) remains consistent. 

When you reach out to a prospect or customer, make sure you're the right person:
- **üêã "Sales-ready" prospect**: The rep (AE) determines the best way to contact the prospective customer, which is often the Solutions Consultant reaching out to help.
- **üå¶Ô∏è Customers**: The Customer Success Manager (CSM) reaches out.
- **ü´ß Any other prospects**: The Solutions Consultant (SC) reaches out.


### Programs

Fleet's community programs are rooted in several areas; created to nurture communication between all current and future Fleet users through [events](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/go-to-market-groups#events), community support, [social media](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/go-to-market-groups#social-media), [ads](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/go-to-market-groups#ads), [video](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/go-to-market-groups#video), and articles.


#### Social media

Fleet's largest asset is our user community, the people actually using Fleet. Public conversations on social media create valuable opportunities for contributors to answer technical questions and collect feedback.

Fleet [does not self-promote](https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Impact-Equation-Audiobook/B00AR1VFBU).  (Great brands are [magnanimous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnanimity).) In fact, conversations are already happening in our social spaces that open up opportunities for Fleet to [engage with the community](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/marketing#engage-with-the-community).

Here are some topics for social media posts:
- Fleet the product
- Internal progress
- Highlighting community contributions
- Highlighting Fleet and osquery accomplishments
- Industry news about osquery
- Industry news about device management
- Upcoming events, interviews, and podcasts


##### Fleet on LinkedIn

Original posts on LinkedIn by Fleet employees [can be promoted using the Fleet company page](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/marketing#promote-a-post-on-linkedin). If you think your post would make sense in front of a bigger audience, [create an issue on the demand board](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/marketing#contact-us) linking the team to your personal LinkedIn post (only original posts please, re-posts and quotes of other posts can not be promoted). Include any context in the issue and keep an eye on your inbox, The Demand team will request permission to use the post in a promoted post.


#### Ads

Fleet uses advertising to spread awareness through a broader audience and foster greater engagement within user communities. The more people actively using Fleet, or contributing, the better Fleet will be.


#### Events

It's important for Fleet to engage at [events](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YQXAX2Q_WnGkAwMYjMbQpV3nbCj7gOBbv7Y0u4twxzQ/edit#gid=1931288160). This provides an opportunity to directly engage with potential users and contributors, build relationships, gather feedback, and create a stronger sense of community and trust.


##### Event follow-up

Event-goers expect a timely [follow-up from Fleet](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/marketing#upload-contacts-to-salesforce-after-an-event) based on the conversations that they had at the event.

1. Once a list of badge scans is available, fleeties who attended the event are to add any follow-up notes, including primary buying situation, amount of endpoints, level of interest, and general talking points.
2. Within three business days of returning from the event, attendees will set up a debrief meeting with the demand team to discuss follow-up and provide the list of badge scans uploaded to the ["Events" folder in Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1uXf95V6CHKHnqxRc9iQr0a0FnTZk3bXR).


#### Podcast

Fleet has created the [ExpedITioners podcast](https://expeditioners.podbean.com/) to open discussions and help IT and security professionals get ahead of the curve and prepare themselves and their organizations for what lies ahead. 


#### Video

Fleet uses YouTube to help keep the community up-to-date and informed. These videos facilitate community engagement, provide educational resources, and help share essential information about Fleet and the people using it. Meetings regularly uploaded to YouTube will have a "‚ñ∂Ô∏è" emoji prepended to the calendar event title (e.g. "‚ñ∂Ô∏è ‚òÅÔ∏èüåà Sprint demos!").  

<img width="384" alt="image" src="https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/assets/618009/29167232-652c-4c64-a37c-910cc781f2c1">


## Processing intent signals

Intent signals help measure an individual's/organization's current level of engagement with the Fleet brand and help us:  
- Created/update contact and/or accounts in Fleet's CRM. 
- Prioritize accounts for [research](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/marketing#research-an-account).
- Identify accounts/contacts that would benefit from a POV conversation.

When processing intent signals, prioritize accounts in the following order:
1. Sales-ready: Accounts currently assigned to reps (i.e. pipeline + stage0 + pre-pipeline IQMs).
2. Ads running: Accounts with trending psychological progression (as measured by fleetdm.com website signups (i.e. new contacts ¬± contacts that have increased their psystage to a certain point).
3. Researched: Key accounts that fleeties have suggested to prioritize.


## Research

ADRs research accounts to ensure there's a practical need Fleet can solve before we attempt to reach out. By doing the groundwork of validating account data and gauging initial intent, we can ensure the organizations that we reach out to [benefit from deeper discussions](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/go-to-market-groups#proof-of-value-pov) around making Fleet a practical solution.


## Warm-up actions

Warm-up actions are that Fleet will take at any point in time to help move the psychological progress of contacts on any account.
Our ADRs stay connected with Fleet‚Äôs engineering team to keep technical knowledge current and to coordinate any outreach. Everyone‚Äôs time is valuable, and this approach ensures that prospects have direct access to engineers who speak their language. (Munki, DDM, patch management, EPSS, etc.)


## Proof of value (POV)

When the prospect is ready to "kick the tires/do a POC", the opportunity is moved to "Stage 3 - Requested POV"  in Salesforce. The AE and SC work together with the prospect to define a timeline and the "definition of done" in order to scope the POV. This planning helps us avoid costly detours that can take a long time, and result in folks getting lost. 


### Spin up a POV

You can set up a Fleet Managed Cloud environment for a prospect with >300 hosts, or you can help them generate a trial license key to configure on their own self-managed Fleet server.

- **To set up a new Fleet Managed Cloud environment** for a user: First, [create a "New customer environment" issue](https://fleetdm.com/docs/configuration/fleet-server-configuration#license-key).  Then, once the environment is set up, you'll get a notification and you can let the user know.
- **To set up only a trial license key** for a user's self-managed Fleet server: Point the user towards fleetdm.com/start, where they can sign up and choose to "Run your own trial with Docker".  On that page, they'll see a license key located in the `fleectl preview` CLI instructions, and they can configure this by copying and pasting it as the [`FLEET_LICENSE_KEY`](https://fleetdm.com/docs/configuration/fleet-server-configuration#license-key)  environment variable on the server(s) where Fleet is deployed.


## Signatures


### Getting a contract reviewed

The [Digital Experience team](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/digital-experience#team) will review all contracts within **2 business days**. 

> If a document is ready for signature and does not need to be reviewed or negotiated, you can skip the review process and [get the contract signed](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/communications#getting-a-contract-signed). Please submit other legal questions and requests to [Digital Experience](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/digital-experience#contact-us).

To get a contract reviewed, complete the [contract review issue template in GitHub](https://github.com/fleetdm/confidential/issues/new?assignees=hollidayn&labels=%23g-digital-experience&projects=&template=contract-review.md&title=Review%3A++%F0%9F%96%8B%EF%B8%8F+__________________________). Upload the docx version whenever possible and be sure to include the link to the document in the issue. Follow-up comments should be made in the GitHub issue and in the document itself to avoid losing context.

If an agreement requires additional review during the negotiation process, the requestor will need to upload the new draft agreement and repeat the process. When no further review or action is required, the requestor is responsible for [routing the document](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/communications#getting-a-contract-signed) for signature.


### Getting a contract signed

The SLA for contract signature is **2 business days**. Please do not follow up on signatures unless this time has elapsed. If a contract is ready for signature and **DOES NOT** require [review or revision](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/communications#getting-a-contract-reviewed) (i.e. no contract review issue necessary), follow the steps below:

First, log into DocuSign (credentials in 1Password) and route the agreement to the CEO for signature. When a contract is going to be routed for signature by someone outside of Fleet (i.e. the vendor or customer), the requestor is responsible for working with the other party to make sure the document gets routed to the CEO for signature.

Then, at-mention the [Head of Digital Experience](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/digital-experience#team) in the appropriate internal Slack channel (e.g. op channel, #g-digital-experience) with the following template:

```
@Sam Pfluger - :writing_hand Signature request
The following contract is ready to sign and has been routed to the CEO for signature: CONTRACT_DOC_URL_FROM_GOOGLE_DRIVE
```

Please use [Fleet's billing email address](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/communications#email-relays) for all contracts and never include individual emails in any company agreement. If the agreement includes any individual emails, please remove them before routing the agreement to the CEO for signature.


### Vendor questionnaires 

Occasionally, prospective customers will ask us to complete a questionnaire. In responding to security questionnaires, Fleet endeavors to provide full transparency via our [security policies](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/digital-experience/security#security-policies), [trust](https://trust.fleetdm.com/), and [application security](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/digital-experience/security#application-security) documentation. In addition to this documentation, please refer to [the vendor questionnaires page](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/digital-experience//security#vendor-questionnaires). [Contact the Sales department](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/sales#contact-us) to address any pending questionnaires.
