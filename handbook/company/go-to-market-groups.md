# ü¶Ñ Go-To-Market groups

This page covers the journey from prospect to customer and details what contributors (fleeties or not) need to know in order to make changes to the Go-To-Market (GTM) [philosophy](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/why-this-way#why-dont-we-sell-like-everyone-else), [strategy](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/communications#strategy), and actions at Fleet.


## Why cross-functional GTM groups?

When communicating with future or current customers, hand offs [between departments](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company#org-chart), contributors, or external organizations can negatively effect the "Return On Investment" (ROI) for Fleet, our customers, and our friends in the community. Cross-functional GTM groups minimize hand offs between internal and external stakeholders and maximize iteration and efficiency in the way we engauge with the market.


> - Use this "ü¶Ñ Go-To-Market groups" page to write down philosophies and show how the different pieces of the GTM process fit together.
> - Use the dedicated [departmental](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company#org-chart) handbook pages for [ü´ß Demand](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/marketing), [üåê Digital Experience](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/digital-experience), [üêã Sales](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/sales), [üå¶Ô∏è Customer Success](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/customer-success), and [üí∏ Finance](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/finance) to keep track of specific responsibilities and recurring rituals designed to be read and used only by people within those departments.
