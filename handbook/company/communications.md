# Communications

Fleet's [open-core](https://www.heavybit.com/library/video/commercial-open-source-business-strategies) style of communication and the [tools we use](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/170qjzvyGjmbFhwS4Mucotxnw_JvyAjYv4qpwBrS6Gl8/edit?usp=sharing) are part of the company's DNA and essential to moving Fleet into the future.

## Zoom

We use [Zoom](https://zoom.us) for virtual meetings at Fleet, and it is important that every team member feels comfortable hosting, joining, and scheduling Zoom meetings.
By default, Zoom settings are the same for all Fleet team members, but you can change your personal settings on your [profile settings](https://zoom.us/profile/setting) page. 
Settings that have a lock icon next to them have been locked by an administrator and cannot be changed. Zoom administrators can change settings for all team members on the [account settings page](https://zoom.us/account/setting) or for individual accounts on the [user management page](https://zoom.us/account/user#/).


## Slack

At Fleet, we do not send internal emails to each other. Instead, we prefer to use [Slack](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/remote-work-how-set-boundaries-when-office-your-house-lora-vaughn/) to communicate with other folks who work at Fleet.
We use threads in Slack as much as possible. Threads help limit noise for other people following the channel and reduce notification overload.
We configure our [working hours in Slack](https://slack.com/help/articles/360025054173-Set-up-Slack-for-work-hours-) to make sure everyone knows when they can get in touch with others.

### Slack channel prefixes
We have specific channels for various topics, but we also have more general channels for the teams at Fleet.
We use these prefixes to organize the Fleet Slack:
 * ***g-***: for team/group channels *(Note: "g-" is short for "grupo" or "group")*.
 * ***oooh-***: used to discuss and share interesting information about a topic.
 * ***help-***: for asking for help on specific topics.
 * ***at*** or ***fleet-at***: for customer channels.
 * ***2023-***: for temporary channels _(Note: specify the relevant year in four digits, like "YYYY-`)_

#### Slack communications and best practices
In consideration of our team, Fleet avoids using global tags in channels (i.e. @here, @channel, etc). 
      1. What about polls? Good question, Fleeties are asked to post their poll in the channel and @mention the teammates they would like to hear from. 
      2. Why does this matter? Great question! The Fleet [culture](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company#culture) is pretty simple: think of others, and remember the company [Values](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company#values).


## Meetings

Plan to join meetings on time. At Fleet, we start on time and do not wait for folks to join.  
Our meetings are conducted over zoom, please join with a working microphone and with your camera on whenever possible.  
Being even a few minutes late can make a big difference and slow your meeting counterparts down. When in doubt, show up a couple of minutes early.

Spend the first few minutes of a meeting being present and making small talk. 
Since we are all remote, it's easy to miss out on hallway chatter and human connections that happen in [meatspace](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/meatspace).  
Use this time together during the first minute to say "Hi!"  Then you can jump into the topics to be discussed.

Turning on your camera allows for more complete and intuitive verbal and non-verbal communication. 
Feel free to leave your camera on or turn it off when joining meetings with new participants you might not be familiar with yet. Turn your camera on when you lead or cohost a meeting.
In an all-remote company, “face time” matters. 

***Before scheduling a meeting*** ask yourself:

1. Can this information be presented [async](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/why-this-way#why-handbook-first-strategy)?
   
   - Is there another way to distribute this info or align on a course of action that _doesn't_ take valuable time away from customers, projects, or personal time?
   - Could you create a [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TaZ654gTwadWGDYhP3zuAzWe0eiY0s9NhaU9KLCokgw/edit) and share it with would-be attendees? If the info can be documented it should be. Could the info be sent in Slack or by email? 
   
2. Do I have all the information needed to schedule this meeting?
   -TODO 


### Internal meeting scheduling

Fleet uses the Zoom add-on for Google Calendar to schedule meetings (exceptions are customers that are non-negotiably required to use a different tool) when we [create calendar events](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/72143?hl=en&ref_topic=10510646&sjid=7187599067132459840-NA#zippy=%2Cclick-an-empty-time-in-your-calendar). 
Our Zoom meetings are configured to let participants join before the host arrives, to make sure meetings start on time even if the host isn't there.

To schedule a meeting within Fleet:
- To add a Zoom meeting to a calendar event, click the "Add video conferencing" dropdown and select "Zoom Meeting." Google Calendar will automatically add the Zoom meeting details and instructions to join the event.
- Enter the `@fleetdm.com` emails for each participant into the "Add guests" box in Google Calendar, and the calendar availability for each participant will appear in your view.
- Select a meeting time, the participants will automatically be invited and a video conference will be attached to the invite (this can save a lot of communication overhead when scheduling with multiple participants).

It is important to [set your workinghours](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/7638168?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop) in Google Calendar and block out any personal time/events/PTO, so that team members do not inadvertently schedule a time when you are not available. 
- Many team members use the free tier of [reclaim.ai](https://reclaim.ai/) to synchronize personal event times (without event details) into their work calendars. 
It is also common practice to block out time for focused work.

### Modifying an event organized by someone else

To edit an event where someone else at Fleet is the organizer, you can first subscribe to their calendar in Google Calendar and then edit the event on their calendar.  Your edits will automatically apply to all attendees.
This works because every Fleetie grants edit access to everyone else at Fleet as part of onboarding.

### External meeting scheduling

When scheduling external meetings, provide external participants with a
[Calendly](https://calendly.com) link to schedule with the relevant internal participants. If you
need a Calendly account, reach out to `mikermcneil` via Slack.


## Email relays

There are several special email addresses that automatically relay messages to the appropriate people at Fleet. Each email address meets a minimum response time ("Min RT"), expressed in business hours/days, and has a dedicated, directly responsible individual (DRI) who is responsible for reading and replying to emails sent to that address.  You can see a list of those email addresses in ["Contacting Fleet" (private Google doc)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tE-NpNfw1icmU2MjYuBRib0VWBPVAdmq4NiCrpuI0F0/edit#).


## Github

### GitHub labels
We use special characters to define different types of GitHub labels. By combining labels, we
organize and categorize GitHub issues. This reduces the total number of labels required while
maintaining an expressive labeling system. For example, instead of a label called
`platform-dev-backend`, we use `#platform :dev ~backend`.

| Special character | Label type  | Examples                            |
|:------------------|:------------|:------------------------------------|
| `#`               | Noun        | `#platform`, `#interface`, `#agent`
| `:`               | Verb        | `:dev`, `:research`, `:design`
| `~`               | Adjective   | `~blocked`, `~frontend`, `~backend`

## Writing

You don’t have to be a “writer” to write documentation. Nobody knows Fleet better than the people who are building our product. 
### Remember the reader
People come from different backgrounds. New users may not know terms that are common knowledge for seasoned developers. Since Fleet has users all over the world, English may not be their first language. Your writing must be easy for any user to understand.
- **Think of every user.** Define technical terms in your writing or include a link.
- **Strive for simplicity.** Avoid complex sentences and long paragraphs.
- **Be approachable.** Write like you’re meeting a new member of your team.

### Answer the question
It’s what we’re all about at Fleet. People read docs in order to accomplish their goals. Those goals can vary from learning about Fleet for the first time to looking for troubleshooting tips. Make sure your doc meets the specific need of the user at that moment.

- **Understand the question.** Be clear about the topic you’re discussing.
- **Narrow your focus.** Avoid explanations that distract from the main topic.
- **No more, no less.** Use just enough information to give an accurate answer.

### Follow a framework
Starting with a blank page can be scary. That’s why it helps to have a framework for your writing. Follow these four steps to write your docs: introduction, explanation, reference, and troubleshooting.

#### Introduction
Give an overview of the topic. You don’t need to mention everything at the beginning. Briefly establish the question you’re addressing. People want to get to the answer A.S.A.P.

#### Explanation
You’ve let users know why they’re reading your doc. It’s time to make sure they understand the topic. This will be most of your documentation. Don’t shy away from details.

#### Reference
Support your explanation with relevant references. This shows users how to put your explanation into practice. Such material will keep users coming back.

#### Troubleshooting
Nothing is perfect. Your readers understand this. Users will appreciate it if you identify common problems — and provide solutions — before they encounter these issues later.

### Document every change
Any change to Fleet’s code should be documented, from adding patches to building features. This allows users and Fleeties to stay up to date with improvements to our product.

You don’t need to wait until a change has been made to write a new doc. Starting with documentation can help you discover ways to make Fleet even better.

Writing about how to use a new feature puts you in the shoes of the user. If something seems complicated, you have the opportunity to improve it — before committing a line of code.

### Writing style
  - Infuse the core [values](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company#values) into everything you write. 
  - Read and reread, then rewrite to make it shorter. Use links rather than explanations, short sentences. 
  - Get to where you feel like it’s really good, short, simple, and clear, hack away at any word that’s too confusing. 
  - Don’t sound formal, sound welcoming so that anyone can understand. Translate "puffery" into "ease of use" or "readability". 
  - Apply the advice about writing linked from the company values (the [Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/simply.html) essays). 
  - Create headings that make good permalinks, use links and add missing links. Indicate links by highlighting words that describe the content (Better SEO than lighting up “click here”). 
  - Don’t duplicate content, link to other places like the [values](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company#values) or [“why this way”](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/why-this-way#why-this-way), but don’t make it awkward. 
  - A big goal is to be able to link directly to this stuff when something comes up as a gentle way to remind and train using the foundation we've already built. 
  - Avoid unnecessary changes, and don’t change headings lightly (it breaks handbook links people might have put in an external article or have in their email inbox somewhere). 
  - Read your PRs, check it carefully with each change and edit until the diff looks good.
  - Check preview mode in GitHub to make sure the format renders correctly. If you look at your diff and notice unintentional changes, remove them.


### What would Mister Rogers say?
[*Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mister_Rogers%27_Neighborhood) was one of the longest-running children’s TV series. That’s thanks to [Fred Rogers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Rogers)’ communication skills. He knew kids heard things differently than adults. So, he checked every line to avoid confusion and encourage positivity.

Our audience is a little older. But just like the show, Mister Rogers’ method is appropriate for all ages. Here are some steps you can take to communicate like Mister Rogers:

- State the idea you want to express as clearly as possible.
- Rephrase the idea in a positive manner.
- Rephrase the idea, directing your reader to authorities they trust.
- Rephrase the idea to eliminate anything that may not apply to your reader.
- Add a motivational idea that gives your reader a reason to follow your advice.
- Rephrase the new statement, repeating the first step.

Consider this example tweet.

<blockquote purpose= "large-quote">- Distributed workforces aren’t going anywhere anytime soon. It’s past time to start engaging meaningfully with your workforce and getting them to work with your security team instead of around them.</blockquote>

What would Mister Rogers say? The tweet could look something like this...

<blockquote purpose= "large-quote">- Distributed workforces are here to stay. So, it’s a great time to help employees work with your security experts (and not around them). Because stronger teams get to celebrate more victories.</blockquote>

By Mister Rogersing our writing, we can encourage our readers to succeed by emphasizing optimism. You might not be able to apply all of these steps every time. That’s fine. Think of these as guidelines to help you simplify complex topics.


### Grammarly
All of our writers and editors have access to Grammarly, which comes with a handy set of tools, including:
- **Style guide**, which helps us write consistently in the style of Fleet.
- **Brand tones** to keep the tone of our messaging consistent with just the right amount of confidence, optimism, and joy.
- **Snippets** to turn commonly used phrases, sentences, and paragraphs (such as calls to action, thank you messages, etc.) into consistent, reusable snippets to save time.


### Using sentence case and capitalization

#### Sentence case
Fleet uses sentence case capitalization for all headings, subheadings, button text in the Fleet product, fleetdm.com, the documentation, the handbook, marketing material, direct emails, in Slack, and in every other conceivable situation.

In sentence case, we write and capitalize words as if they were in sentences:

<blockquote purpose= "large-quote"> Ask questions about your servers, containers, and laptops running Linux, Windows, and macOS.</blockquote>

As we use sentence case, only the first word is capitalized. But, if a word would normally be capitalized in the sentence (e.g., a proper noun, an acronym, or a stylization) it should remain capitalized.

- Proper nouns _("Nudge", "Skimbleshanks", "Kleenex")_
  - "Yeah, we use Nudge"
  - "Introducing our friend Skimbleshanks"
  - "Please, can I have a Kleenex?"
- Acronyms _("MDM", "REST", "API", "JSON")_
  - "MDM commands in Fleet are available over a REST API that returns JSON"
- Stylizations _("macOS", "osquery", "MySQL")
  - "Although 'macOS' is a proper noun, macOS uses its own style guide from Apple, to which we adhere"
  - "Zach is the co-creator of osquery"
  - "Does it work with MySQL?"

- ***Struggling with this?*** It takes some adjustment, and you need repetitions of seeing things written this way and correcting yourself. Contributors have given feedback that this [opinionated solution](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/why-this-way#why-does-fleet-use-sentence-case) is a huge relief once you build the habit of sentence case capitalization. You don't have to think as hard, nor choose between flouting and diligently adhering to the style guide.

#### Capitalization and proper nouns
- **Fleet:** When talking about Fleet the company, we stylize our name as either "Fleet" or "Fleet Device Management."
- **Fleet the product:** We say either “Fleet” or “Fleet for osquery.”
- **Core team members:** Team members who've signed an NDA employment agreement, are “Fleeties.”
- **Group of devices or virtual servers:** Use "fleet" or "fleets" (lowercase).  
- **Osquery:** Osquery should always be written in lowercase unless used to start a sentence or heading.


#### Device vs endpoint
- When talking about a users' computer, we prefer to use "device" over _endpoint._ Devices in this context can be a physical device or virtual instance that connect to and exchange information with a computer network. Examples of devices include mobile devices, desktop computers, laptop computers, virtual machines, and servers.


### Headings
Headings help readers quickly scan content to find what they need and guide readers through your writing. Organize page content using clear headings specific to the topic they describe. 

While our readers are more tech-savvy than most, we can’t expect them to recognize queries by SQL alone.  Avoid using code for headings. Instead, say what the code does and include code examples in the body of your document.

Keep headings brief, organized, and in a logical order:
- H1: Page title
- H2: Main headings
- H3: Subheadings
- H4: Sub-subheadings

Try to stay within three or four heading levels. Detailed documents may use more, but pages with a simpler structure are easier to read.

#### Punctuation in headings
Fleet headings do not use end punctuation unless the heading is a question:

<blockquote purpose= "large-quote">Learn how to use osquery, nanoMDM, and Nudge to manage and monitor laptops and servers running Linux, Windows, ChromeOS, and macOS</blockquote>

If the heading is a question, end the heading with a question mark.

### Grammar mechanics

#### Contractions 
They’re great! Don’t be afraid to use them. They’ll help your writing sound more approachable

#### Ampersands 
(&) Only use ampersands if they appear in a brand name, or if you’re quoting the title of an article from another source. Otherwise, write out “and”.

#### Commas 
When listing three or more things, use commas to separate the words. This is called a serial comma.

✅**Do:** Fleet is for IT professionals, client platform engineers, and security practitioners.

❌**Don’t:** Fleet is for IT professionals, client platform engineers and security practitioners.

Aside from the serial comma, use commas, as usual, to break up your sentences. If you’re unsure whether you need a comma, saying the sentence aloud can give you a clue. If you pause or take a breath, that’s when you probably need a comma.

#### Hyphens
✅**Do** use a hyphen to indicate a range:
- Monday-Friday

✅**Do** use a hyphen for compound modifiers. This is when 2 or more words function as one adjective. Compound modifiers precede the noun they modify:
- We release Fleet on a three-week cadence.
- Osquery is an open-source agent.

❌**Don’t** use a hyphen when modifying words follow the noun:
- Fleet is released every three weeks.
- Osquery is open source.

#### Colons 
Colons introduce one or more elements that add detail to the idea before the colon. 

✅**Do** use a colon to introduce a list:
- The Fleet product has 4 interfaces: Fleet UI, REST API, fleetctl CLI, and Fleet Desktop.

✅**Do** use a colon to introduce a phrase (Only capitalize the first word following a colon if it’s a proper noun):
- Introducing Sandbox: the fastest way to play with Fleet.

#### Exclamation points 
They’re fun! But too many can undermine your credibility!!!1! Please use them sparingly. Take context into consideration. And only use one at a time.

#### Abbreviations and acronyms
If there’s a chance your reader won’t recognize an abbreviation or acronym, spell it out the first time you mention it and specify the abbreviation in parentheses. 

Then use the short version for all other references.
- A command-line interface (CLI) is a text-based user interface (UI) used to run programs, manage computer files, and interact with the computer.
- The Fleet CLI is called fleetctl.
If the abbreviation or acronym is well known, like API or HTML, use it instead (and don’t worry about spelling it out).

### Numbers and times

#### Numbers
Spell out a number when it begins a sentence. Otherwise, use the numeral. 

Sometimes numerals seem out of place. If an expression typically spells out the number, leave it as is:
- First impression
- Third-party integration
- All-in-one platform
Numbers over 3 digits get commas:
- 999
- 1,000
- 150,000

#### Times
Use numerals and am or pm without a space in between:
- 7am
- 7:30pm
Use a hyphen between times to indicate a time period:
- 7am–10:30pm

We have users and Fleeties all over the world.🌎 Specify time zones when scheduling events or meetings.

Abbreviate time zones within the continental United States as follows:
- Eastern time: ET
- Central time: CT
- Mountain time: MT
- Pacific time: PT

Spell out international time zones:
- Central European Time
- Japan Standard Time

### Emphasis
- **Bold:** Use bold text to emphasize words or phrases. Just don’t overdo it. Too much bold text may make it hard to see what’s really important.

- _Italics:_ Use italics when referencing UI elements (e.g., buttons and navigation labels):
  - On the settings page, go to *Organization Settings* and select *Fleet Desktop*.

### Lists
Lists help readers scan content for essential information. They should be as concise and symmetrical as possible.
If you find your list running long, or if each item contains several sentences, you may want to reconsider whether a list is the best approach.
Use a numbered list if it follows a specific order or includes a set number of items. Otherwise, use bullet points.

#### How to introduce a list 
✅**Do** use a colon if you introduce a list with a complete sentence.

❌**Don’t** use a colon if you start a list right after a heading.

#### How to use end punctuation with list items
End punctuation refers to punctuation marks that are used to end sentences, such as periods, question marks, and exclamation points.

✅**Do** use end punctuation if your list items are complete sentences:
- Project confidence and be informative.
- Educate users about security threats positively.
- We never use fear as a marketing tactic.

❌**Don’t** use end punctuation if your list items are sentence fragments, single words, or short phrases:
- Policies
- Enterprise support
- Self-hosted agent auto-updates

❌**Don’t** mix complete sentences with sentence fragments, single words, or short phrases. Consistent formatting makes lists easier to read.

❌**Don’t** use commas or semicolons to end bullet points.

#### How to capitalize list items
✅**Do** use a capital letter at the beginning of every bullet point. The only exceptions are words that follow specific style guides (e.g., macOS).

### Web elements

#### SQL statements

When adding SQL statements, all SQL reserved words should be uppercase, and all identifiers (such as tables and columns) should be lowercase. Here’s an example:

`SELECT days, hours, total_seconds FROM uptime;`


## Writing in Markdown
Markdown is a simple formatting syntax used to write content on the web. In order to publish content like articles, docs, or handbook entries, you must format your content in Markdown. 




## Vision for dept handbook pages

The idea here is to get this vision implemented on a single departmental handbook page first, starting with handbook/company/ceo.  It's hard to know what the philosophy should be until we can see it.  So we need to shorten the feedback loop so we can see it change live in one place.  That way we can iterate in one place instead of having things go a bunch of different directions, and adding in all the complexity of extra redirects to keep track of and all that stuff.  Then once we've got that looking good and have iterated a bit, we'll spread it out.

Another thing is that we need to get a better intuitive understanding of who these pages are designed to serve.  So in order to put ourselves in their shoes (get behind their eyeballs), we need something to look at.  So doing a particular page first provides us with that canvas.

- (h1) Top-level page title/ file name
    
  - (h2) Short section on _departmentally specific philosophy_ and the purpose of the page: If philosophy applies to more than your department, **pull it out**, make it easier for contributors to find.
  - **Nice to have:** Tiny little link/sentence/button with call-to-action that links you to intake or intake options)

- (h2) How can I… (outward facing first: e.g.non-Fleetie contributor)
    
  - e.g. (h3) CEO flaws
  - e.g. (h3) Scheduling with the CEO
  - e.g. (h3) Summoning the CEO (travel)

- (h2) How-tos (Inward facing e.g. Fleetie)
  - e.g. (h2) Process CEO email

- (h2) Intake

- (h2) Kanban

- (h2) Rituals
  
- (h2) Slack channels










## Levels of confidentiality

- *Public*   _(share with anyone, anywhere in the world)_
- *Confidential*  _(share only with team members who've signed an NDA, consulting agreement, or employment agreement)_
- *Classified*  _(share only with founders of Fleet, business operations, and/or the people involved.  e.g., US social security numbers during hiring)_
