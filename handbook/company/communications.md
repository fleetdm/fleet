# Communications
This page covers the things every team member needs to know to effectively contribute at Fleet.


## All hands

Every month, Fleet holds a company-wide meeting called the "All hands". 

All team members should attend the "All hands" every month.  "All hands" meetings are recorded. To see the evolution over time or catch up with the latest happenings, review [decks](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cw_lL3_Xu9ZOXKGPghh8F4tc0ND9kQeY) and [recordings](https://us-65885.app.gong.io/conversations?workspace-id=9148397688380544352&callSearch=%7B%22search%22%3A%7B%22type%22%3A%22And%22%2C%22filters%22%3A%5B%7B%22type%22%3A%22CallTitle%22%2C%22phrase%22%3A%22all%20hands%22%7D%5D%7D%7D) from recent company-wide "All hands" meetings. Team members who cannot attend are expected to watch the recording within a few days. 


### E-group 

Every week, the "Executive" or "E-group", including the CEO, CTO, Head of Product Design, CRO, CFO, VP of Customer Success, will hold a 30-minute "¶ 🗣 Roundup (E-Group)" meeting to discuss the company's immediate needs and address any blockers.

Every three weeks, the E-group will meet for a more in-depth discussion immediately following the "¶ 🗣 Roundup (E-Group)" meeting, regarding the achievement of strategic short and long-term company goals. This is the "¶ 🗣 E-Group review" meeting, typically held from 3-5pm CT.  If one of the department heads cannot attend this meeting, the Executive Assistant will reschedule the E-group review as close to the original time as possible, while verifying that all E-group members can attend. 

The "[¶ 🗣 E-Group weekly [no shadows]](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13fjq3T0bZGOUah9cqHVxngckv0EB2R24A3gfl5cH7eo/edit?tab=t.0)" agenda will be processed every week and used for all E-group meetings. 


### Strategy

You can read background about how Fleet reached its positioning and product strategy in ["🎐 Why Fleet?" (private Google doc)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E0VU4AcB6UTVRd4JKD45Saxh9Gz-mkO3LnGSTBDLEZo/edit#). You can read about Fleet's Go-To-Market (GTM) strategy on our [Go-To-Market groups page](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/go-to-market-groups).

You can find all planned events in the ["🎪 Events" (private Google doc)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YQXAX2Q_WnGkAwMYjMbQpV3nbCj7gOBbv7Y0u4twxzQ/edit?gid=1931288160#gid=1931288160).  And in the [📈 OKRs (private Google doc)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Hso0LxqwrRVINCyW_n436bNHmoqhoLhC8bcbvLPOs9A/edit#gid=1846478041), you can read about:
- Current and upcoming quarterly goals, and the company's progress towards them
- Planned marketing campaigns
- Upcoming content
- Marketing budgets

The ambition of Fleet's product roadmap is to reach [product maturity](http://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/product-maturity-assessment) across every stage of the computing lifecycle, implemented in a way that delights customers by delivering on our core brand promises: openness, flexibility, accessibility, and clarity.  The priority of features is [weighed (private Google doc)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zwr59MpruIw4dsV-Qbk8xFbMrbHAV3qaRJDWM7-YrwU/edit?gid=1189480063#gid=1189480063) against this framework while taking into account the timelines of customers as well as the competitive landscape.  At the start of every quarter, Fleet publishes a blog post and video about the roadmap for the next 3 months.


## Security 

Security policies are best when they're alive, in context of how an organization operates.  Fleeties [follow onboarding and offboarding SLAs](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/it/security#human-resources-security-policy), [carry Yubikeys](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/it/security#hardware-security-keys), use a password manager (even for [personal devices](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/it/security#personal-mobile-devices)), implement change control of [policies](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/it/security#security-policies), [recover their accounts via strict processes](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/it/security#account-recovery-process), and access control is driven primarily through GitOps and SSO. 


### Trust

Fleet is successful because of our customers and community, and those relationships are built on [trust](https://fleetdm.com/trust).

> **Compliance**
> Community members can request compliance documentation (e.g. Fleet's SOC2 Type 2 report) at https://fleetdm.com/trust. In its current form, our SOC 2 report is intended to be shared only with parties who have signed a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) with Fleet. Internal stakeholders can [download approved documents](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/go-to-market-groups#fleets-vendor-collateral) from Google Drive.

## Meetings

**Plan to join meetings on time.** At Fleet, we start on time and do not wait for folks to join.  As most of our meetings are conducted over zoom, please join with a working microphone and with your camera on whenever possible.  Being even a few minutes late can make a big difference and slow your meeting counterparts down. When in doubt, show up a couple of minutes early. 

**Turn on your camera.** This allows for more complete and intuitive verbal and non-verbal communication. Feel free to leave your camera on or turn it off when joining meetings with new participants you might not be familiar with yet. Turn your camera on when you lead or cohost a meeting, or when you present your work during a demo session.

**If you would prefer not to be on YouTube** when presenting on a meeting, you can prep your demo ahead of the meeting and communicate to your manager who will present for you.  It's always ok to do this.

**Be warm.**  It's okay to spend the first minute or two of a meeting being present and making small talk. Since we are all remote, it's easy to miss out on hallway chatter and human connections that happen in [meatspace](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/meatspace).  Use this time together during the first minute to say "Hi!"  Then you can jump into the topics to be discussed.

**When sharing your screen** during a public meeting, refrain from displaying sensitive information such as customer names, private messages, or other confidential information.

> **[OpenBlur](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/openblur/dlnglldcaegkgmhmmhhdknblccppichf?pli=1)** is a web extension that automatically blurs elements containing specific keywords on any webpage. This allows you to hide secrets from online meetings or anyone viewing your screen. Created by Victor Lyuboslavsky ([@getvictor](https://github.com/getvictor)).

**Take notes.** Every meeting should have a [DRI](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/why-this-way#why-direct-responsibility) to ensure: 
  - The agenda creation and/or prep beforehand. 
  - There is a designated notetaker during the meeting. 
  - All action items are tracked and assigned to the correct individuals. 


> ***Zoom***
> We use [Zoom](https://zoom.us) for virtual meetings at Fleet, and it is important that every team member feels comfortable hosting, joining, and scheduling Zoom meetings. By default, some settings have been intentionally locked and can't be changed, but others can be adjusted on your [profile settings](https://zoom.us/profile/setting) page.
>
> Need help with Zoom? Reach out to 🌐 [IT](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/it#contact-us).


### Recording meetings

Capturing video from meetings with customers, prospects, and community members outside the company is an important part of building world-class sales and customer success teams and is a widespread practice across the industry. At Fleet, we use Gong to capture Zoom meetings and share them company-wide. If a team member with a Gong license attends certain meetings, generally those with at least one person from outside of Fleet in attendance.  
  - While some Fleeties may have a Gong seat that is necessary in their work, the typical use case at Fleet is for employees on the company's sales, customer success, or customer support teams. 
  - You should be notified anytime you join a recorded call with an audio message announcing "this meeting is being recorded" or "recording in progress."  To stop a recording, the host of the call can press "Stop." 
  - If the call has external participants and is recorded, this call is stored in Gong for future use. 
To access a recording saved in Gong, visit [app.gong.io](https://app.gong.io) and sign in with SSO. 
  - Everyone at Fleet has access, whether they have a Gong seat or not, and you can explore and search through any uploaded call transcripts unless someone marks them as private (though the best practice would be not to record any calls you don't want to be captured). 
If you ever make a mistake and need to delete something, you can delete the video in Gong or reach out to 🌐 [IT](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/it#contact-us) for help. They will delete it immediately without watching the video. 
  - Note that any recording stopped within 60 seconds of the start of the recording is not saved in Gong, and there will be no saved record of it. 

Most folks at Fleet should see no difference in their meetings if they aren't interfacing with external parties. 
Our goal in using Gong and recording calls is to capture insights from sales, customer, and community meetings and improve how we position and sell our product. We never intend to make anyone uncomfortable, and we hope you reach out to our DRI for Gong, 🌐 [IT](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/it#contact-us) if you have questions or concerns.  


> ***Excluding calls from being recorded***
>
> For those with a Gong seat or scheduling a call with someone in attendance that has a Gong seat who does not wish for their Zoom call with an external party to record, make sure your calendar event title contains `[no shadows]`.  You can also read the [complete list of exclusion rules](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OOxLajvqf-on5I8viN7k6aCzqEWS2B24_mE47OefutE/edit?usp=sharing).


#### Sharing a local Zoom recording 

In some instances, you may need to record a call locally (i.e. save the recording on your computer and not in the cloud ☁️). You can use the following steps to upload the call recording:
1. Log into [Zoom](https://zoom.us/recording) using SSO (Single-Sign-On) and go to "Recordings". 
2. After the recording is finished processing (which sometimes can take a couple of hours), you will see the hotdog (or "overflow menu") menu appear. Select the call you want to share and use the hotdog menu to download all files.
3. Rename the mp4 file to match the meeting name and prefix it with the date of the recording (e.g. "YYYY-MM-DD *Name of the calendar event*").
4. Upload the mp4 recording to the [whiteboards folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1prO98fmB2WKzpubZ2-z0sju9dQ4ijpNE) in Google Drive.


> **Confidentiality reminder:**
>
> Fleet meetings titled with "▶️" are considered public by default unless [otherwise specified](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/communications#levels-of-confidentiality). All public meeting transcripts and video are screened for confidential information before being published. If confidential information (e.g. customer names, IP addresses, GitHub secrets, etc.) is revealed via screen share or audio during the recording of a public meeting, any team member on the call that notices sensitive information should verbally say, "Pineapple, pineapple, pineapple." 
>
> 🍍🍍🍍 Why three times? This helps ensure that at least one of the "Pineapple" call-outs will be transcribed correctly. 🍍🍍🍍   

Videos are transcribed, and this makes it easier to find required redactions during the editing process before [upload](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/demand#upload-to-youtube).


## Scheduling a meeting

To schedule a meeting within Fleet:
- To add a Zoom meeting to a calendar event, click the "Add video conferencing" dropdown and select "Zoom Meeting." Google Calendar will automatically add the Zoom meeting details and instructions to join the event.
- Enter the `@fleetdm.com` emails for each participant into the "Add guests" box in Google Calendar, and the calendar availability for each participant will appear in your view.
- Select a meeting time, the participants will automatically be invited and a video conference will be attached to the invite (this can save a lot of communication overhead when scheduling with multiple participants).

**Internal meeting scheduling**: Fleet uses the Zoom add-on for Google Calendar to schedule meetings (exceptions are customers that are non-negotiably required to use a different tool) when we [create calendar events](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/72143?hl=en&ref_topic=10510646&sjid=7187599067132459840-NA#zippy=%2Cclick-an-empty-time-in-your-calendar). 
Our Zoom meetings are configured to let participants join before the host arrives, to make sure meetings start on time even if the host isn't there.

**External meetings**: When scheduling external meetings, provide external participants with a
[Calendly](https://calendly.com) link to schedule with the relevant internal participants. 

> Need a Calendly account? Reach out to 🌐 [IT](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/it#contact-us).

It is important to [set your working hours](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/7638168?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop) in Google Calendar and block out any personal time/events/PTO, so that team members do not inadvertently schedule a time when you are not available. Many team members use the free tier of [reclaim.ai](https://reclaim.ai/) to synchronize personal event times (without event details) into their work calendars. 

It is also common practice to block out time for focused work. In an all-remote company, "face time" matters. Remember: even if someone's calendar is open, they have other work to do. Help each other by batching up internal meetings which enables longer, uninterrupted stretches of deep work.


## Meeting agendas

["**No agenda, no attenda**."](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/live-doc-meetings/#gitlab-meeting-best-practices) Every work-related meeting should have an editable agenda (e.g. edit access shared with all attendees) attached to the calendar invite. 
- To create a meeting agenda please make a copy of [Fleet's meeting template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TaZ654gTwadWGDYhP3zuAzWe0eiY0s9NhaU9KLCokgw/copy).

> Tired of making agendas manually? Ask the 💸 [GTM Systems Architect](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/finance#contact-us) about our [meeting notes automation](https://fleetdm.zoom.us/clips/share/Gd69AuhMSqGIN7NE8JxPvA). Please do not use Google Calendar's automatic agenda/notes creation function, as it does not adhere to Fleet's preferred agenda format. If the automatic agenda doc has been created in error, edit the calendar invite to delete it from the meeting to avoid confusion.


### Modifying an event organized by someone else

To edit an event where someone else at Fleet is the organizer, you can first subscribe to their calendar in Google Calendar and then edit the event on their calendar.  Your edits will automatically apply to all attendees.
This works because every Fleetie grants edit access to everyone else at Fleet as part of onboarding.


### Shared calendars

Team calendars are the primary source for sprint rituals; they facilitate the execution of each sprint. 
Looking to add, change, or remove a shared calendar? [Create an issue](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/people#contact-us) and the appropriate DRI will reply with feedback.

### 1:1 meetings 

All managers at Fleet have [1:1 meetings](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/leadership/1-1/) with their direct reports at least once a month. These are dedicated spaces for coaching, two-way feedback, and alignment on priorities. To schedule a 1:1:
1. Create a copy of the [1:1 agenda template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dxN1Q0GMawFrgKB_KxJ77N2pS-vXmopB358r-Q8Gxis/edit?tab=t.0) and rename the document "🧑‍🚀 YOUR_GITHUB_USER_NAME : SUPERVISOR_GITHUB_USER_NAME".
2. [Schedule a meeting](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/communications#internal-meeting-scheduling) with your manager and title the calendar event by copying your 1:1 agenda title and appending "[no shadows]" to the end (this tells other team members that this is a private conversation).
3. Link the agenda in the calendar event description before saving.


### Skip-level 1:1 meetings 

Fleet uses skip-level 1:1 meetings as a recurring pulse check to encourage [valuable personal and departmental feedback](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/communications#performance-feedback) across the org. This helps the leadership at Fleet run an effective company with a great team, good alignment, and quick decisions. To schedule a skip-Level 1:1:
1. Create a copy of the ["Skip-level 1:1 agenda template"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/191wiy-_a9XBMndLlM97iOwUF6a-0PtkbboQ2FCUIy6w/copy) and rename the document "🧑‍🚀 YOUR_GITHUB_USER_NAME : SUPERVISOR_GITHUB_USER_NAME".
2. [Schedule a meeting](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/communications#internal-meeting-scheduling) with your manager's supervisor and title the calendar event by copying your skip-level agenda title and appending "[no shadows]" to the end (this tells other team members that this is a private conversation).
3. Link the skip-level agenda in the calendar event description before saving.


> **Are you scheduling time with the CEO?**
>
> Please do not add events to the CEO's calendar, *even if the CEO asks you to*. Instead, [get scheduling help from the Executive Assistant](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/leadership#schedule-time-with-the-ceo)).


## Email relays

There are [several special email addresses](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tE-NpNfw1icmU2MjYuBRib0VWBPVAdmq4NiCrpuI0F0/edit#) that automatically relay messages to the appropriate people in Fleet. Each email address meets a minimum response time ("Min RT"), expressed in business hours/days, and has a dedicated, directly responsible individual (DRI) who is responsible for reading and replying to emails sent to that address.


## Levels of confidentiality

Fleet uses these levels to standardize a commitment to minimal esotericism across the company.  
- **Public:**   _Share with anyone, anywhere in the world_
- **Confidential:**  _Share only with team members who've signed an NDA, consulting agreement, or employment agreement_
- **Classified:**  _Share only with the CEO, Executive Assistant, Head of People, GTM Systems Architect, and/or the people involved.  e.g., US social security numbers during hiring_


### Document titles

Fleet uses these levels to standardize a commitment to minimal esotericism across the company. 
- **"Public":** _(Available to public)_ 
- _(Confidential - for Fleet eyes only)_     
- **"¶":** _(E-group - Direct reports the the CEO)_
- **"¶¶":** _(Classified - CEO, Executive Assistant, Head of People, and GTM Systems Architect)_


## Company database

Fleet uses Google Drive to keep files correctly bucketed and accessible for team members. When adding a file, you can: 
- Check for existing files to avoid duplication.
- Avoid breaking Google Drive links. In some cases, you can update files by using the "Manage versions" option (in the right-click menu) so that links continue to work.


## Communicating with team members

At Fleet, we do not send internal emails to each other. Instead, we prefer to use [Slack](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/remote-work-how-set-boundaries-when-office-your-house-lora-vaughn/) to communicate with other folks who work at Fleet.
- We use [channels over DMs](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/why-this-way#why-group-slack-channels).
- We use threads in Slack as much as possible. Threads help limit noise for other people following the channel and reduce notification overload.
- We configure our [working hours in Slack](https://slack.com/help/articles/360025054173-Set-up-Slack-for-work-hours-) to make sure everyone knows when they can get in touch with others.
- In consideration of our team, Fleet avoids using global tags in channels (i.e. @here, @channel, etc.) (What about polls? Good question, Fleeties are asked to post their poll in the channel and @mention the teammates they would like to hear from.)
- To save everyone time, please [don't ask to ask: just ask](https://dontasktoask.com/).

> **Need an app that you don't see in Fleet Slack?** [Create a IT issue](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/it#contact-us) to request an app be added to the Fleet Slack workspace.


### Key Slack channels

We use these prefixes to organize the Fleet Slack:
 - ***2025-***: For temporary channels that will be closed in a matter of weeks or months. _(Note: specify the relevant year in four digits, like "YYYY-`)_
 - ***_***: An automated feed.
 - ***test-***: For testing custom Slack integrations before connecting to real channels.
 - ***oooh-***: For sharing news/tips/cool finds about a non-political, work-related subject.
 - ***2025-hiring-***: For private communication during the hiring process.
 - ***help-***: For questions, assistance, and resources on a topic or from a vendor.
   - ***help-`VENDOR_NAME`-vendor***: A channel for communication between one of Fleet's vendors and the internal stakeholders.
   - ***help-`PARTNER_NAME`-partnership***: A channel for communication between one of Fleet's partners and the internal stakeholders. 
 - ***g-***: A cross-functional group channel (i.e. a product or GTM group, "g-" is short for "grupo" or "group").
 - ***op-***: A private internal channel about a new revenue opportunity.
 - ***acc-***: A private internal channel about a customer account.
 - ***fleet-at-***: A Fleet support+sales channel for a customer or prospect, with them in it.


We have specific channels for various topics, but we also have more general channels for the teams at Fleet. The following Slack channels are useful for every fleetie:

## Fleetdm.com

Any change to fleetdm.com follows the same process as [making changes](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/product-groups#making-changes) to the core product. To propose a change to Fleet's website [create a website request](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/issues/new?assignees=&labels=%23g-website&projects=&template=website-request.md&title=Website%20request%3A+__________________________) on the #g-website kanban board. 

Before committing anything to code, we create wireframes (referred to as ["drafting"](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/product-groups#making-changes)) to illustrate all changes that affect the layout and structure of the user interface, design, or APIs of fleetdm.com. See [Why do we use a wireframe first approach](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/why-this-way#why-do-we-use-a-wireframe-first-approach) for more information. 

The [Product Design](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/product-design#team) holds regular design review sessions to evaluate, revise, and approve wireframes before moving into production. Design review sessions are hosted by the [Head of Design](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=bXRob21hc0BmbGVldGRtLmNvbQ) and typically take place daily, late afternoon (CT). Anyone is welcome to join.


## Design at Fleet

We use Figma for virtually all our design work. This includes the Fleet product, our website, and our marketing collateral. 

- **Fleet product:** All product design work is done in the [Fleet product](https://www.figma.com/files/project/17318630/%F0%9F%94%9C%F0%9F%93%A6-Fleet-EE%C2%AE-(product)?fuid=1234929285759903870) Figma project.  
See [📖Product#Working with Figma](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/product#working-with-figma) for more details.
- **Fleet website:** All website design work is done in the [fleetdm.com (current, dev-ready)](https://www.figma.com/file/yLP0vJ8Ms4GbCoofLwptwS/%E2%9C%85-fleetdm.com-(current%2C-dev-ready)?node-id=794%3A373) Figma file.
- **Design system:** Shared logos, typography styles, and UI components can be found in [Design system](https://www.figma.com/files/project/15701210).
- **NOTE:** The Figma docs in Design System contain the master components that are referenced throughout all other Figma files. Use caution when modifying these components, as changes will be reflected in the master Fleet EE (scratchpad) and fleetdm.com (current, dev-ready) Figma docs.

**Marketing assets:** Product screenshots and artwork for social media, articles, and other marketing assets can be found in [Collateral](https://www.figma.com/files/project/20798819).


## Change management

Fleet uses GitHub as the [source of truth](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/why-this-way#why-do-we-use-one-repo) for the product and documentation. GitHub allows community members to interact with Fleet, [contribute and provide feedback](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/blob/main/docs/Contributing/guides/committing-changes.md#committing-changes).


### Getting GitHub notifications in Slack 

Fleet uses Toast to get GitHub notifications right from Slack. 

Toast only notifies people about: 
- Brand new comments that at-mention them.
- New requests to review PRs.
- Their PRs having been reviewed.

Toast does NOT notify people about: 
- New issues assigned to them.
- Existing issues being assigned to them.
- Comments on issues assigned to them.
- Edits of comments to add at-mentions of them.
- Edits of descriptions to add at-mentions of them.
- New issues that at-mention them in the description.
  

### Issue labels

Fleet prefixes all GitHub labels with special characters or words to organize and categorize GitHub issues.

| Prefix            | Label type  | Examples                            |
|:------------------|:------------|:------------------------------------|
| `:`               | Verb        | `:dev`, `:research`, `:design`
| `~`               | Adjective   | `~blocked`, `~frontend`, `~backend`
| `customer-`       | [Customer request](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/customer-success#assign-a-customer-codename) | `customer-leo`, `customer-sagittarius`
| `#g-`             | Group isssue | _An issue requesting something from a group at Fleet, such that it will be seen and procesed on their kanban board within 1 business day._

Opinionated conventions help people work faster and spend less time figuring out what to name things, or misunderstanding why they're named what they are.  This also reduces the total number of labels required while maintaining an expressive labeling system. Labels with a `#g-` prefix refer to a kanban board. Since it is best practice to have an issue on a single board, make an effort to have only one label with the `#g-` prefix per issue.


_**Note:**_ There are only a few "special" labels that are exceptions to this rule:
- `bug` A defect in the product.
- `story` A user story.
- `timebox` A timeboxed issue (a task or bug limited to a fixed duration, after which work stops regardless of completion).
-  `prospect-` A customer prospect.
- `P-` A [priority level](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/communications#high-priority-user-stories-and-bugs).


> If you're adding multiple labels to an issue template, GitHub won't add both labels unless you put them in an array e.g. `labels: ['~air-guitar', ':product']`.  To verify the syntax is correct, you can preview the template and make sure each label name is in a separate box.  


> ***Create an issue from a Slack message***
>
> If you need to track content from a Slack channel (e.g. #help-customers), you can automatically generate a GitHub issue by adding the emoji `create-github-issue` as a reaction to any message. This will automatically: 
> - Create an issue tagged with the departmental GitHub label that corresponds with the Slack channel. If there isn't a corresponding departmental label for the channel, the issue defaults to the [:help-it](https://github.com/orgs/fleetdm/projects/101) kanban board.



### Process new requests

Team members [process their department's kanban boards](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/why-this-way#why-lean-software-development) daily, prioritizing all new requests, including issues and PRs, within one business day.

To process intake team members will:
- Inspect each item in the "📨 New requests" column and understand the next steps needed to complete the task.
- Indicate to the requestor when they can expect the task to be completed by placing each item in the appropriate column (e.g. Not yet, Planned, In progress) and estimate if necessary.
- If the goal/user story is unclear, assign the issue to the requestor and at-mention them in an issue comment asking to clarify the intended action. 
- If the task is to be backlogged (i.e. "Not yet"), place the issue in the "Not yet" column and at-mention the requestor in an issue comment. Explain why the task is unable to be prioritized and provide a tentative ETA on when the task will be completed.



### Propose an event

Fleet's Marketing team is responsible for deciding/signing off on the events Fleet will participate in. To propose an event, complete the steps in the [Propose event issue](https://github.com/fleetdm/confidential/issues/new?template=prepare-event.md). Once the requester has completed all steps, the marketing team will process your request within 72 business hours.



### Estimation points

Estimation points represent the effort required to complete a task. After accessing wireframes, we typically play planning poker, a gamified estimation technique, to determine the necessary story point value. We use the following story points to estimate tasks:

| Story point | Time |
|:---|:--------------|
| 1  | 1 to 2 hours  |
| 2  | 2 to 4 hours  |
| 3  | 1 day         |
| 5  | 2 to 3 days   |
| 8  | Up to a week  |
| 13 | 1 to 2 weeks  |

> Larger projects are estimated in a way that can sometimes look disproportionate to account for edge cases that weren't caught during planning. This helps us develop [iteratively](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company#results) and deliver bite-sized functionality on more predictable time scales.


## High-priority user stories and bugs

All issues are treated as standard priority by default. Some issues are assigned a priority label to indicate the level of urgency.

- Emergency: `P0`
  - Examples: Customer outage, confirmed security vulnerability ([critical bug](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/product-groups#release-testing)), a new feature is needed to address an immediate Fleet emergency.
  - Response: Immediately stop other work to swarm the issue. Work 24/7 in shifts until resolved.
  - Impact: Significant impact. May void current sprint.

- Critical: `P1`
  - Examples: A supported workflow is broken ([critical bug](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/product-groups#release-testing)), a potential security vulnerability, a new feature is required to address an immediate critical Fleet need.
  - Response: Issue brought to next standup for estimation and immediately brought into the sprint. Necessary team members are assigned as their top priority.
  - Impact: High impact. Does not void sprint, but reduces overall velocity and requires deprioritizing other work.

- Urgent: `P2`
  - Examples: A supported workflow is not functioning as intended, a newly drafted feature has an associated urgent Fleet need.
  - Response: Issue is prioritized at the top of the next sprint. If opportunity cost of waiting for the next sprint is too high, it may be considered for current sprint.
  - Impact: Low to medium impact. If prioritized into current sprint, may reduce overall velocity and require deprioritizing other work.

Any fleetie can follow the process below to add a priority label to an issue.

1. Add as much context as possible to the issue description and assign labels to help the team
   understand the problem and what is driving the urgency. 
2. Add the `P0`, `P1`, or `P2` label based on the urgency of the issue. 
3. Comment on the GitHub issue explaining why the issue is a priority, and assign the issue to the [Engineering Manager for the associated product group](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/product-groups#current-product-groups). For immediate action, follow up with the EM via Slack DM or by phone.
4. The EM will review the issue to determine if it meets the criteria for the assigned priority label. If so, they will triage as needed based on priority level. If not, they will remove the priority label and add a comment on the issue explaining why.

## Contributing to the handbook and docs

> Fleet operates as a [handbook-first](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/why-this-way#why-handbook-first-strategy) company.  If something has changed, it is up to you to update the handbook first.  If the change can't be handbooked in 1 business day, or if you are stuck waiting on a review before it can be merged, get a handbook coach.  They'll pair with you in a scheduled meeting on your calendar and help.  To get a handbook coach, ask [Sam Pfluger](https://fleetdm.slack.com/team/U05CS07KASK) in Slack.

Learn how to contribute to the handbook, documentation, and articles at Fleet on the ["Writing at Fleet" handbook page](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/writing).


## Feedback

At Fleet, performance feedback is a continuous process. We give feedback (particularly negative) as soon as possible. Managers at Fleet will provide performance feedback [during scheduled 1:1 meetings](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/leadership#performance-feedback), if not sooner. When sharing feedback publicly, it's important to remember what feedback _is_: 
- Feedback is something to share with the DRI, who has the context and mission to hear your feedback and decide what to do.
- Feedback is better shared in a way that doesn't ping the customer. Reading it doesn't help them. 
- Feedback is ready to share. If it's just an opinion without a solution or an opinion about a customer's contribution without specifically saying why the contribution would make the product worse, it's not feedback that's ready to share.
- Feedback is how we improve. We encourage all Fleeties to share candid and helpful feedback with each other. We use the "4A" feedback pattern:

When _giving_ feedback:

1. **Aim to assist**: Feedback must be given with positive intent. Feedback must be framed around how it can help the individual or the company.
2. **Actionable**: Feedback must be actionable and focus on what the recipient can do differently.

When _receiving_ feedback:

3. **Appreciate**: It is natural to feel defensive when hearing criticism. Rather than immediately reacting, listen carefully and be open-minded without becoming defensive or angry.
4. **Accept or discard**: Listen and consider all feedback, then decide to accept or discard. The decision to react to the feedback is entirely up to the recipient.

> When delivering feedback, you can also use the [other person's personality type](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OSLn-ZCbGSjPusHPiR5dwQhheH1K8-xqyZdsOe9y7qc/edit#gid=0&range=AA1) as [a guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iWHYJzc6WKdR95GBFAvjumouh0ej2DQM/view).  For example, when delivering feedback to a ["type 1" personality](https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/type-1/), it helps to focus on minimizing the extent to which the person spirals into self-blame.  In contrast, when delivering feedback to a ["type 7" personality](https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/type-7/), it is better to focus on being sensitive to the person's tendency to avoid negative emotions and reframe things positively.


## Spending company money

As we continue to expand our company policies, we use [GitLab's open expense policy](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/finance/spending-company-money/) as a guide for company spending.
In brief, this means that as a Fleet team member, you may:
- Spend company money like it is your own money.
- [Spend less](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/why-this-way#why-spend-less).  Purchase what you need to do your job effectively.
- Feel free to make purchases __in the company's interest__ without asking for permission beforehand (when in doubt, do __inform__ your manager prior to purchase or as soon as possible after the purchase).
- For purchases ≥ $1,000 in amount, please make sure there is a receipt/invoice in the transaction details. Brex sometimes does not automatically append those details to the transactions. 

For more developed thoughts about __spending guidelines and limits__, please read [GitLab's open expense policy](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/finance/spending-company-money/).


### Paying back company money

If you have accidentally incurred a charge on your Brex card that was not intended and/or approved, you can initiate a "Repay" process in Brex that would allow you to pay back the company. 

1. Login to [brex.com](http://brex.com/) with your Fleet email and navigate to the "[Wallet](https://dashboard.brex.com/wallet)".
2. Select the transaction you'd like to repay.

> If you need to split the transaction amount:
>   - Ensure the transaction is in the "Approved" status. If it's not in "Approved" status yet, wait a few days and retry. 
>   - Click "Itemize this expense."
>   - Separate out the amount that needs to be repaid.
>   - Click "Itemize" and proceed to the next step.

3. On the bottom right-hand side, click on "Repay".
4. Select the desired bank account and verify the account.
5. Click "confirm repayment".

After a short period of processing, your transaction will show as “denied”, and this means the repayment is in process. 
  
  
## Travel

When attending a conference or traveling for Fleet, keep the following in mind:
- **No reimbursements:** Use your company Brex card.  Reimbursements are time-consuming, so Fleet does not offer reimbursements for spending on personal credit cards.
- **Food:** Be efficient and use your own credit card when it makes sense.  There is a $100 allowance per day for your own personal food and beverage on your company Brex card. There are many good reasons to make exceptions to this allowance, such as dinners with customers.
- **Tipping:** Tipping norms vary by culture.  How you tip when representing the company reflects on Fleet's brand.  When traveling in the United States and using your company Brex card, prepare to tip between 18-20% at restaurants.  For rideshare, takeout, delivery, and other situations where tipping comes up, tip between 10-20%.
- **Personal credit card:** Please use your personal credit card for hotel incidentals, personal consumables, movies, mini bars, and entertainment.  These expenses _will not_ be reimbursed.
- **Company credit card:** We recommend you order a physical Brex card if you do not have one before traveling.
- **Credit card limit increases:** The monthly limit on your Brex card may need to be increased temporarily as necessary to accommodate the increased spending associated with the conference, such as [booking your own travel](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/communications#flights).  You can [request that here](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/finance#contact-us) by providing the following information:
  - The start and end dates for your trip.
  - The [price of your flight](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/communications#flights)
  - The [price of your hotel or Airbnb](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/communications#lodging) per night
  - The price of the admission fees (if attending a conference)


### Flights

Everyone at Fleet, including the CEO, uses the same [principles for booking flights](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/ceo#schedule-travel-for-the-ceo). For example, feel free to book a direct flight if there is one that is less than double the price of the cheapest non-direct flight.


### Mileage reimbursement

When you travel for work and choose to drive your own vehicle, you can use your Brex card to purchase fuel (or Electric Vehicle charging) *or* request reimbursement based on the mileage driven. To request reimbursement, you'll need:
- A personal bank account to link to Brex. (This is required for reimbursement. Use your Brex card to purchase fuel if you would like to avoid providing your banking details.)
- The start and end destination of your journey (Brex will automatically calculate the reimbursement amount based on this data).
- The reason for the trip.

To request reimbursement for miles driven: 
1. Navigate to [Brex](https://dashboard.brex.com/wallet)
2. Click "Request reimbursement," then "Mileage."
3. Select your available Brex spending limit and the travel date.
4. Enter your starting and ending destinations, and whether it was one-way or round-trip. Brex will automatically calculate your miles driven. If the distance doesn't match what you actually drove, edit it to be correct.
5. In the memo line, describe the reason for your travel (E.g. Houston GitOps) and submit the request.

Finance will review and process your request within 2 business days. 


### Lodging

- Choose a modest location with inexpensive lodging and [minimally-viable comfort](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/why-this-way#why-spend-less).
- For events, check the event's website for travel & hotel accommodations and book as soon as the event is approved. As a general rule, do not spend more on lodging than the average listed hotel accommodations.
- Avoid expensive neighborhoods and popular destination cities.
- Please do not share bedrooms.  Shared bathrooms are OK, but make sure every hotel room or Airbnb has at least one bathroom per gender identity.   <!-- Make sure everyone is well-rested, efficiently primped, with sufficient privacy. -->
- Be creative.  If Airbnb is the most efficient way to house the team, then do that.  If separate hotel rooms are more efficient, then do that.
- If the stay is longer than 4 nights and an Airbnb with a washing machine is not available, then dry cleaning can be purchased with your Brex card.
- If you need to meet with a large group that won't fit in your hotel room or Airbnb (e.g. more than 5 people), [contact People](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/people#contact-us) for their help approving and booking additional event space.

### Attending conferences

The Marketing department is responsible for executing and organizing all [marketing-related events](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/marketing#settle-event-strategy). When attending a conference for Fleet, treat it [like other travel for the company](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/communications#travel). The relevant department head should approve and organize all other event types (trainings, developer conferences, meetups, etc.).

<img width="384" alt="image" src="https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/assets/618009/8c3eeeb4-f322-44cf-8405-4f94f10fde6d">


### Offsites

From time to time, Fleet organizes offsites to bring team members together in person.  This encourages trust and makes the company more productive. Offsites are:
  - Attended by a particular [product group](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company#product-groups), a [department](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company#org-chart), or a team such as the E-group.
  - Sometimes also attended by founders or other team members on a case-by-case basis.
  - 1-3 full days long (2-4 nights stay).
  - A ritual of effective teams, not a reward or vacation.
  - Driven by a detailed, thoughtful agenda of how time will be spent.  An intentional investment of valuable personal and company time, at great opportunity cost.
  - An opportunity to spend time together, build relationships, and be human.  Shared meals and activities are important.

Follow the process to [request an offsite](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/leadership#request-a-team-offsite) and [plan an offsite](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/leadership#plan-a-team-offsite).


##### Sales kickoffs

From time to time, Fleet holds a sales kickoff (SKO) meeting.  This is a type of [offsite](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/communications#offsites).


### Coworking

Your Brex card may be used for up to $500 USD per month in coworking costs. Please get prior approval from the Head of People. 


### Relocating

When Fleeties relocate, there are vendors that need to be notified of the change. Before relocating, please create a [💼 Teammate relocation](https://github.com/fleetdm/confidential/issues/new?assignees=&labels=%3Ahelp-people&projects=&template=x-teammate-relocation.md) issue to [let the company know in advance](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/people#update-personnel-details) by following the directions listed in the relevant issue template.


## Tools and equipment

Fleet provides laptops, YubiKey security keys, and software licenses for core team members to use while working at Fleet. If you need new equipment or would like to propose a tool to be used internally at Fleet, [create an issue](https://github.com/fleetdm/confidential/issues/new?assignees=&labels=%3Ahelp-it&projects=&template=1-custom-request.md&title=) on the 🌐 IT kanban board.


### Requesting new equipment

As soon as an offer is accepted, IT & Enablement will reach out to the new team member to start this process and will work with the new team member to get their equipment requested and shipped to them on time. From time to time, team members need to purchase additional equipment in the interest of the company. If you are in need of additional equipment for any reason, [open a warehouse request](https://github.com/fleetdm/confidential/issues/new?template=warehouse-request.md) with IT & Enablement. When possible, Fleet will pull from its warehouse of existing assets before spending [more money on new equipment](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/why-this-way#why-spend-less).

- **Tracking equipment:** All company-owned devices are tracked in Fleet's ["🍽️ Dogfood" instance](https://dogfood.fleetdm.com/dashboard). When a device is purchased, it's automatically enrolled in dogfood.

- **Returning equipment:** Apple computers with remaining AppleCare Protection Plans should be reprovisioned to other Fleeties who may have older or less-capable computers. Equipment should be returned once offboarded for reprovisioning. Coordinate offboarding and return with the Head of IT. Please return all equipment to the Fleet IT warehouse using Fleet's FedEx account (address and account # in 1Password).

- **Equipment retention and replacement:** Older equipment results in lost productivity of Fleeties and should be considered for replacement. Replacement candidates are computers that are no longer under an AppleCare+ Protection Plan (or another warranty plan), are >3 years from the [discontinued date](https://everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook_pro/index-macbookpro.html#specs), or when the "Battery condition" status in Fleet is less than "Normal". The old equipment should be evaluated for return or retention as a test environment.

> If your Apple device is less than 3 years old, has normal battery condition, but is experiencing operating difficulties, you should first contact Apple support and troubleshoot performance issues before requesting a new device.


#### Requesting IT support

If you are in need of IT support, reach out to 🌐 [IT](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/it#contact-us) to assist with a software or hardware issue. [Open a support request](https://github.com/fleetdm/confidential/issues/new?assignees=&labels=%3Ahelp-it&projects=&template=1-custom-request.md&title=) and a Fleet IT team member will attempt to correct your issue remotely using Fleet, and will notify you if any action is needed on your part.


## Taking time off

When you need to take time off, follow this process:
- Let your manager and team know the days when you will be out by posting a message in your department Slack channel mentioning your manager, with when and how long.
- Life happens and things come up.  But as soon as you know when you'll be out, let the company know.  (Extra notice helps!)
- Find someone to cover anything that needs covering while you're out and communicate what they need to take over the responsibilities as well as who to refer to for help (e.g., meetings, planned tasks, unfinished business, important Slack/email threads, [CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/blob/main/CODEOWNERS) coverage, anything where someone might be depending on you).
- Mark an all-day "Out of office" event in Google Calendar for the day(s) you're taking off, or for the hours that you will be off if less than a day. Google Calendar recognizes the event title "OOO" and will give you the option to decline existing and new meetings or just new meetings. You are expected to attend any meetings that you have accepted, so be sure to decline meetings you are not going to attend.
  - If you are the DRI of meetings, especially external meetings with prospects and customers, be sure not to use an "Out of Office" (OOO) event, because it will cancel the meeting.  Instead, you can find someone else at Fleet to cover the meeting.
- If you can’t complete these steps because you need to take the day off quickly due to an emergency, let your manager know and they will help you complete the handoff.
- If you ever want to take a day off, and the only thing stopping you is internal (Fleetie-only) meetings, don’t stress. Consider, “Is this a meeting that I can reschedule to another day, or is this a meeting that can go on without me and not interfere with the company’s plans?” Talk to your manager if you’re unsure, but it is perfectly OK to reschedule internal meetings that can wait so that you can take a day off.
- This process is the same for any days you take off, whether it's a holiday or you just need a break.


### Holidays

At Fleet, we have team members with various employment classifications in many different countries worldwide. Fleet is a US company, but we think you should choose the days you want to work and what days you are on holiday, rather than being locked into any particular nation or culture's expectation about when to take time off. When a team member joins Fleet, they pick one of the following holiday schedules:
 - **Traditional**: This is based on the country where you work. Non-US team members should let their managers know the dates of national holidays.
 **Or**
 - **Freestyle**: You have no set schedule and start with no holidays. Then you add the days that are holidays to you.

Either way, it's up to you to make sure that your responsibilities are covered and that your team knows you're out of the office.


## Benefits

In this section, you can find information about Fleet's benefit strategies and decisions.


### Paid time off

What matters most is your results, which are driven by your focus, your availability to collaborate, and the time and consideration you put into your work. Fleet offers all team members unlimited time off. Whether you're sick, you want to take a trip, you are eager for some time to relax, or you need to get some chores done around the house, any reason is a good reason.

For team members working in jurisdictions that require certain mandatory sick leave or PTO policies, Fleet complies to the extent required by law.


### New parent leave

Fleet gives new parents six weeks of paid leave. After six weeks, if you don't feel ready to return yet, we'll set up a quick call to discuss and work together to come up with a plan to help you return to work gradually or when you're ready.


### Retirement contributions

**US-based team members:** Starting August 2023, Fleet offers the ability for US-based team members to contribute to a 401(k) retirement plan directly from their salary. Team members will be auto-enrolled in our plan with Guideline at a default 3% contribution unless they opt out or change their contribution amount within 30 days of commencement. Auto-enrolled employees' contributions will increase by 1% every year, on January 1, until 10% is reached. Fleet currently does not match any contributions made by team members to 401(k) plans.

**Non-US team members**: Fleet meets the relevant country's retirement contribution requirements for team members outside the US.


### Wellness budget 

Every Fleetie gets up to $80/month on their Brex card to put toward their choice of wellness. [Contact the 🧑‍🚀 People department](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/people#contact-us) with any questions.


### Compensation

Compensation at Fleet is determined by benchmarking using [Pave](https://pave.com). Annual raises are not guaranteed, instead we ensure teammates are compensated fairly based on the role, experience, location, and performance relative to benchmarks.


#### Payroll dates

US-based Fleeties get paid on the last business day of the month. International teammates' pay dates follow the same structure as US pay unless there are in-country requirements that dictate a more frequent cadence.

Variable compensation (i.e. commission) is reviewed and submitted for processing by the [💸 Finance team](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/finance#team) by the 7th of each month for the previous month or quarter's contributions. US-based Fleeties that receive variable compensation will be paid by the 10th. International Fleeties will be paid no later than the last day of the month for the previous month's or quarter’s contributions.


#### Compensation changes

Fleet benchmarks US-based team members based on the United States Dollar (USD). Non-US Fleeties are benchmarked in the local currency.  Compensation decisions are re-benchmarked yearly, shortly after the anniversary of a team member's start date. The Head of People is responsible for the process to [update compensation](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/people#update-a-team-members-compensation).


#### Exercise stock options

Fleet uses Carta to manage its cap table. Fleet option holders can [exercise shares via Carta](https://support.carta.com/kb/guide/en/how-to-exercise-your-options-on-carta-wTFnzZVVFs/Steps/3763569). Before exercising your options, consult your own independent tax advisors or counsel to determine whether you are subject to taxation in any jurisdiction.

- For *Fleeties exercising Non-Qualified Stock Options (NSOs)*, once an exercise request is submitted, it will be reviewed by the CEO before the request is approved in Carta
- For *Fleeties who are US tax residents and employees of the company*, Finance and People will update the withholding tax amount shown in Carta, based on estimates calculated by our US payroll system. If the "Fair Market Value" is less than or equal to the exercised price, the withholding tax amount is zero. If the withholding tax amount is larger than $500, Finance will reach out to confirm the total amount to be debited from your bank account before the request is approved.

> FYI: You can calculate the "Taxable Income" by subtracting the exercised or "strike" price from the "Fair Market Value" of shares at the time of exercise. 
> I.e. _"Fair Market Value" of shares at time of exercise_ - _strike price_ =  "*Taxable income*"

As a US Fleetie, if you choose to "early exercise" your unvested options, you will need to file an 83(b) election within 30days of receiving the shares post exercise. As part of your exercise, Carta automatically generates the 83(b) election form when an option with early exercise enabled is issued. A tab for the 83(b) form will appear as soon as you decide to early exercise their option. This feature allows eligible U.S.-based equity holders to elect to be taxed at the time of grant rather than at the time of vesting. Additionally, Carta sends an email with instructions when a qualifying grant is accepted or an option is exercised. You can also access a pre-filled 83(b) election form directly within the platform.

> Please note that the form must be printed, signed, and mailed to the IRS within 30 days of the grant date. You should also upload a signed copy to the platform for record-keeping purposes. Check out [how to track 83(b) election filings for early exercised option grants](https://support.carta.com/kb/guide/en/how-to-track-83-b-election-filings-for-early-exercised-option-grants-bZaiinjNng/Steps/3835066) for further guidance.

- For *Fleeties who are non-US tax residents*, please follow the instructions on this [page](https://support.carta.com/kb/guide/en/how-to-exercise-your-options-on-carta-wTFnzZVVFs/Steps/3763569,3781094,3780904) to exercise your options


## Workiversaries

We're happy you've ventured a trip around the sun with Fleet- let's celebrate! The team will celebrate your tenure at the monthly "All Hands" meeting to highlight your dedication and contribution to Fleet, giving teammates an opportunity to share their appreciation of your contribution!


## New Fleeties

**Welcome to Fleet!** 

> Fleet is open source. Anyone can contribute at any time. Before a core team member's start date, they are welcome to contribute, but not expected to.

The first 3 weekdays (excluding days off) for **every new team member** at Fleet are reserved for completing their onboarding tasks issue.  New team members **should not work on anything else during this time**, whether or not other tasks are stacking up or assigned.  It is OK, expected, and appreciated for new team members to **remind their manager and colleagues** of this [important](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/why-this-way#why-the-emphasis-on-training) responsibility. Even after the first 3 days, during the rest of their first 2 weeks, completing onboarding tasks on time is a new team member's [highest priority](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/why-this-way#why-the-emphasis-on-training). Onboarding time (all checkboxes checked) is a KPI for the People team, our goal is 14 days or less.


### Recommendations for new teammates

**Understand the company**. Take some time to:
- Learn about the [values we share](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company). (5m read)
- Understand [Fleet's business model](https://www.heavybit.com/library/video/commercial-open-source-business-strategies/).  (35m video or 15m read)
- Get acquainted with [Fleet's history](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company) and our [Fleet investors and advisors](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company#advisors). (5m read)
- Fleet is not affiliated with [GitLab](https://gitlab.com).  But we've learned a lot from [Sid](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/15/gitlab-ceo-eyes-public-market-after-secondary-valued-it-at-6-billion-.html).

**Take the time to get trained.**  
- Up-front training is important, valuable, and often underrated.  Ask a lot of questions, and don't be afraid to bug anyone.
- Without making mistakes, nothing ever gets done.  Everyone at Fleet, especially our CEO, makes [plenty of dumb mistakes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_T-UR9mU4-o&list=PLzn32d5NSCl_DtZ6rcTAwbmunAfvsP5io).
- We strive for a [short feedback loop](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/communications#feedback) and [shorter toes](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#short-toes).
- Everyone has [one-on-one meetings (1:1s)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/leadership/1-1/) between them and their manager. 1:1s are your meeting, with your agenda, prepared by you, ahead of time.

**Get comfortable with the tools**
- We do not send internal emails (except when absolutely necessary).
- We all use the same tools for asynchronous collaboration, including [chat (Slack)](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/communications#communicating-with-team-members), [tasks (GitHub)](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/communications#change-management), [email (gmail.com)](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/communications#email-relays), [calendar (Google Calendar)](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/communications#scheduling-a-meeting), spreadsheets (Google Sheets), [presentations (Google Slides or Keynote)](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/communications#all-hands), and [video calls (Zoom)](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/communications#meetings).
- Everyone at [Fleet uses 1Password](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/communications#security) as their password manager.  We store any passwords and credentials vaguely related to Fleet, including accounts we create ourselves.

**Immerse yourself in the world of device management and security.**
- Here are some podcast episodes which could be great to listen to on a walk, etc:
  - What's the [story behind the creation of osquery and Fleet](https://fleetdm.com/podcasts/the-future-of-device-management-ep1)? (32m listen)
  - [Prima shares her journey into security and what excites her](https://fleetdm.com/podcasts/the-future-of-device-management-ep2) (31m listen)
  - Understanding the business: [Interview with Mike McNeil, CEO »](https://oss-startup-podcast.launchnotes.io/announcements/episode-47-open-source-device-management-with-fleet)
- If you aren't already familiar with device management/security, this can be a lot to take in.   Don't worry if you're still confused.


### Team member onboarding

It's [important](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/why-this-way#why-the-emphasis-on-training) that every team member at Fleet takes the time to get fully trained and onboarded. When a new team member joins Fleet, we create an onboarding issue for them in the [fleetdm/confidential](https://github.com/fleetdm/confidential) repo using this [issue template](https://github.com/fleetdm/confidential/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/onboarding.md). 
We want to make sure that the new team member will be able to complete every task in their issue. To make sure the new team member is successful in their onboarding, we customize their issue by commenting on any tasks they won't need to complete.
We believe in taking onboarding and training seriously and that the onboarding template is an essential source of truth and good use of time for every single new hire. If managers see a step that they don't feel is necessary, they should make a pull request to the [onboarding template](https://github.com/fleetdm/confidential/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/onboarding.md).


#### Sightseeing tour

During their first day at Fleet, new team members join a sightseeing tour call. During this call, the new team member will participate in an interactive tour of the main attractions in our all-remote company, including the primary tools used company-wide, what the human experience is like, and when/why we use them at Fleet.

In this meeting, we'll [use this agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_gAy_ndrRQ-RwHAm4xhZ8rbY8XJZl9QqZBMS7YU2aMY/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.7en766pueek4) to walk through the following:
- Handbook: values, purpose, key pages to pay special attention to
- GitHub issues: the living bloodstream of the company.
- Kanban boards: the bulletin board of quests you can get and how you update status and let folks know things are done.
- Google Calendar: the future.
- Gmail: like any mailbox, full of junk mail, plus some important things, so it is important to check carefully.
- Salesforce: the Rolodex.
- Google Docs: the archives.
- Slack:
  - The "office" (#g-, #general).
  - The walkie talkies (DMs).
  - The watering hole (#oooh-, #random, #news, #help-).


#### Contributor experience training

During their first week at Fleet, every new team member schedules a contributor experience training call. During this call, the new team member will share their screen, and their counterpart will walk them through:
- The handbook at 10,000ft: The structure, the values, the purpose, and key pages to pay special attention to. Check out and read all the way through (check the links).
- GitHub issues: the living bloodstream of the company. 
- Search issues: https://github.com/issues?q=archived%3Afalse+org%3Afleetdm+is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+
- Making sure emails are going to get seen and responded to quickly (make sure inbox management is going to be productive, talk about filters, unsubscribe).
- Making sure Slack messages will get seen and responded to quickly.
- Making sure you know where your issues are tracked, which kanban board you use, and what the columns mean.
- Making sure you can succeed with submitting a PR with the GitHub web editor, modifying docs or handbook, and working with Markdown.
- Talking about Google Calendar. Make sure you know how to see and subscribe to other team members' calendars and that you can add yourself to an event on someone else's calendar.
- A quick tour of the Google Drive folder. Does their access look correct? Give access to executed documents on the shared drive as needed. Show how to use “Add to drive” or “favorite,” or just a browser bookmark, so the folder is easily accessible. This is where things go. It's the archive.
- Make sure you know how to share a Google Doc in the folder for all Fleeties to see and access.
- Make sure new team members understand the expectations of, and [how to prepare](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/leadership#prepare-for-the-program) for, the [CEO shadow program](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/leadership#ceo-shadow-program).

<!--
### Onboarding retrospective

At the end of their first two weeks of onboarding at Fleet, every new team member schedules an onboarding retro call.  Agenda: 
> Welcome once again to the team! Please tell me about your first few weeks at Fleet. How did your onboarding/training go? What didn't you manage to get to? Anything you weren't sure how to do? Any feedback on how we can make the experience better for Fleet's next hire?

Fleet prioritizes a [bias for action](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company#ownership).  If possible, apply onboarding feedback to the handbook and issue templates in realtime, during this call.  This avoids backlogging tasks that may just get out of date before we get around to them anyway.
