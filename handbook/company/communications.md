# Communications

Fleet's [open-core](https://www.heavybit.com/library/video/commercial-open-source-business-strategies) style of communication and the [tools we use](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/170qjzvyGjmbFhwS4Mucotxnw_JvyAjYv4qpwBrS6Gl8/edit?usp=sharing) are part of the company's DNA and essential to moving Fleet into the future.


## Meetings

- **Plan to join meetings on time.** At Fleet, we start on time and do not wait for folks to join.  As most of our meetings are conducted over zoom, please join with a working microphone and with your camera on whenever possible.  Being even a few minutes late can make a big difference and slow your meeting counterparts down. When in doubt, show up a couple of minutes early. 
- **Turning on your camera** allows for more complete and intuitive verbal and non-verbal communication. Feel free to leave your camera on or turn it off when joining meetings with new participants you might not be familiar with yet. Turn your camera on when you lead or cohost a meeting, or when you present your work during a demo session.
- **If you would prefer not to be on YouTube** when presenting on a meeting, you can prep your demo ahead of the meeting and communicate to your manager who will present for you.  It's always ok to do this.
- **Be warm.**  It's okay to spend the first minute or two of a meeting being present and making small talk. Since we are all remote, it's easy to miss out on hallway chatter and human connections that happen in [meatspace](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/meatspace).  Use this time together during the first minute to say "Hi!"  Then you can jump into the topics to be discussed.

<!-- revisit in seperate PR
***Before scheduling a meeting*** ask yourself:

1. Can this information be presented [async](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/why-this-way#why-handbook-first-strategy)?
   
   - Is there another way to distribute this info or align on a course of action that _doesn't_ take valuable time away from customers, projects, or personal time? Could you create a [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TaZ654gTwadWGDYhP3zuAzWe0eiY0s9NhaU9KLCokgw/edit) and share it with would-be attendees? If the info can be documented it should be. Could the info be sent in Slack or by email? 
   
2. Do I have all the information needed to schedule this meeting?
   -TODO 
-->

### External meeting scheduling

When scheduling external meetings, provide external participants with a
[Calendly](https://calendly.com) link to schedule with the relevant internal participants. If you
need a Calendly account, reach out to `mikermcneil` via Slack.


### Internal meeting scheduling

Fleet uses the Zoom add-on for Google Calendar to schedule meetings (exceptions are customers that are non-negotiably required to use a different tool) when we [create calendar events](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/72143?hl=en&ref_topic=10510646&sjid=7187599067132459840-NA#zippy=%2Cclick-an-empty-time-in-your-calendar). 
Our Zoom meetings are configured to let participants join before the host arrives, to make sure meetings start on time even if the host isn't there.

To schedule a meeting within Fleet:
- To add a Zoom meeting to a calendar event, click the "Add video conferencing" dropdown and select "Zoom Meeting." Google Calendar will automatically add the Zoom meeting details and instructions to join the event.
- Enter the `@fleetdm.com` emails for each participant into the "Add guests" box in Google Calendar, and the calendar availability for each participant will appear in your view.
- Select a meeting time, the participants will automatically be invited and a video conference will be attached to the invite (this can save a lot of communication overhead when scheduling with multiple participants).

It is important to [set your workinghours](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/7638168?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop) in Google Calendar and block out any personal time/events/PTO, so that team members do not inadvertently schedule a time when you are not available. 
- Many team members use the free tier of [reclaim.ai](https://reclaim.ai/) to synchronize personal event times (without event details) into their work calendars. 
It is also common practice to block out time for focused work.


#### 0ne on one meetings

#### Performance feedback
At Fleet, performance feedback is a continuous process. We give feedback (particularly negative) as soon as possible. Most feedback will happen during 1:1 meetings, if not sooner.

### Modifying an event organized by someone else

To edit an event where someone else at Fleet is the organizer, you can first subscribe to their calendar in Google Calendar and then edit the event on their calendar.  Your edits will automatically apply to all attendees.
This works because every Fleetie grants edit access to everyone else at Fleet as part of onboarding.



## Email relays

There are several special email addresses that automatically relay messages to the appropriate people at Fleet. Each email address meets a minimum response time ("Min RT"), expressed in business hours/days, and has a dedicated, directly responsible individual (DRI) who is responsible for reading and replying to emails sent to that address.  You can see a list of those email addresses in ["Contacting Fleet" (private Google doc)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tE-NpNfw1icmU2MjYuBRib0VWBPVAdmq4NiCrpuI0F0/edit#).




### Celebrations
At Fleet we like to celebrate sinificant milestones for our teammates! We do this in a variety of ways including company-wide slack messaging. If you would prefer we didn't celebrate your milestone, please submit an [intake issue](#intake) to ensure the team has record of your preference.

#### Workiversaries
We're happy you've ventured a trip around the sun with Fleet- let's celebrate! The BizOps team will post in Slack to highlight your dedication and contribution to Fleet, giving an opportunity for teammates to thare their appreciation of your contribution!
Fleet also [evaluates and (if necessary) updates compensation decisions yearly](#compensation-changes), shortly after the anniversary of a team member's start date.


## Trust
Fleet is successful because of our customers and community, and those relationships are built on trust.


### Spending company money
As we continue to expand our company policies, we use [GitLab's open expense policy](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/spending-company-money/) as a guide for company spending.
In brief, this means that as a Fleet team member, you may:
* Spend company money like it is your own money.
* Be responsible for what you need to purchase or expense to do your job effectively.
* Feel free to make purchases __in the company's interest__ without asking for permission beforehand (when in doubt, do __inform__ your manager prior to purchase or as soon as possible after the purchase).
For more developed thoughts about __spending guidelines and limits__, please read [GitLab's open expense policy](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/spending-company-money/).

#### Brex

##### Travel

###### Attending conferences or company travel
When attending a conference or traveling for Fleet, keep the following in mind:
- $100 allowance per day for your own personal food and beverage. **(There are many good reasons to make exceptions to this guideline, such as dinners with customers.  Before proceeding, please [request approval from the Head of Business Operations](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/business-operations#intake).**
- Tipping norms vary by culture.  How you tip when representing the company reflects on Fleet's brand.  When traveling in the United States and using your company Brex card, prepare to tip between 18-20% at restaurants.  For rideshare, takeout, delivery, and other situations where tipping comes up, tip between 10-20%.
- We highly recommend you order a physical Brex card if you do not have one before attending the conference.
- The monthly limit on your Brex card may need to be increased temporarily as necessary to accommodate the increased spending associated with the conference, such as travel.  You can [request that here](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/business-operations#intake) by providing the following information:
  - The start and end dates for your trip.
  - The price of your flight (feel free to optimize a direct flight if there is one that is less than double the price of the cheapest non-direct flight).
  - The price of your hotel per night (dry cleaning is allowable if the stay is over 3 days).
  - The price of the admission fees if attending a conference.
- Please use your personal credit card for movies, mini bars, and entertainment.  These expenses _will not_ be reimbursed.

##### Non-travel purchases that exceed a Brex cardholder's limit
For non-travel purchases that would require an increase in the Brex cardholder's limit, please [make a request](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/business-operations#intake) with following information:
- The nature of the purchase (i.e. SaaS subscription and what it's used for)
- The cost of the purchase and whether it is a fixed or variable (i.e. use-based) cost.
- Whether it is a one time purchase or a recurring purchase and at what frequency the purchase will re-occur (annually, monthly, etc.)
- If there are more ideal options to pay for the purchase (i.e. bill.com, the Fleet AP Brex card, etc.) that method will be used instead.  
- In general, recurring purchases such as subscription services that will continually stretch the spend limit on a cardholder's Brex card should be paid through other means. 
- For one time purchases where payment via credit card is the most convenient then the card limit will be temporarily increased to accomodate the purchase.  

#### Reimbursements
Fleet does not reimburse expenses. We provide all of our team members with Brex cards for making purchases for the company. For company expenses, **use your Brex card.**  If there was an extreme accident, [get help](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/business-operations#intake).

<!-- 
No longer supported.  -mike, CEO, 2023-04-26.

Fleet will reimburse team members who pay for work-related expenses with their personal funds.
Team members can request reimbursement through [Gusto]([https://app.gusto.com/expenses](https://support.gusto.com/article/209831449100000/Get-reimbursed-for-expenses-as-an-employee)) if they're in the US or [Pilot]([https://pilot.co/](https://help.pilot.co/en/articles/4658204-how-to-request-a-reimbursement#:~:text=If%20you%20made%20a%20purchase,and%20click%20'Add%20new%20expense.)) if they are an international team member. When submitting an expense report, team members need to provide the receipt and a description of the expense.
Operations will review the expense and reach out to the team member if they have any questions. The reimbursement will be added to the team member's next payroll when an expense is approved.
>Pilot handles reimbursements differently depending on if the international team member is classified as an employee or a contractor. If the reimbursement is for a contractor, Operations will need to add the expense reimbursement to an upcoming recurring payment or schedule the reimbursement as an off-cycle payment. If the reimbursement is for an employee, no other action is needed; Pilot will add the reimbursement to the team member's next payroll.  -->

### Individualized expenses
Recurring expenses related to a particular team member, such as coworking fees, are called _individualized expenses_.  These expenses are still considered [non-personnel expenses](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1X-brkmUK7_Rgp7aq42drNcUg8ZipzEiS153uKZSabWc/edit#gid=2112277278), with a few extra considerations:

- Non-recurring (one-off) expenses such as an Uber ride from the airport are NOT considered "individualized".
- Seat licenses for tools like Salesforce or GitHub are NOT considered "individualized".
- Individualized expenses should include the team member's name explicitly in the name of the expense.
- If multiple team members use the same vendor for an individualized expense (for example, "WeWork"), use a separate row for each individualized expense.  (For example: "Coworking, Mungojerry (WeWork)" and "Coworking, Jennyanydots (WeWork)")
- Individualized expenses are always attributed to the  "🔦 Business operations" department.
- These expenses are still considered non-personnel expenses, in the same way seat licenses for tools like Salesforce or GitHub are considered non-personnel expenses.


## Benefits
In this section, you can find information about Fleet's benefit strategies and decisions.

### Paid time off
What matters most is your results, which are driven by your focus, your availability to collaborate, and the time and consideration you put into your work. Fleet offers all team members unlimited time off. Whether you're sick, you want to take a trip, you are eager for some time to relax, or you need to get some chores done around the house, any reason is a good reason.
For team members working in jurisdictions that require certain mandatory sick leave or PTO policies, Fleet complies to the extent required by law.

#### Taking time off
When you need to take time off, follow this process:
- Let your manager and team know the days when you will be out by posting a message in your department Slack channel mentioning your manager, with when and how long.
- Life happens and things come up.  But as soon as you know when you'll be out, let the company know.  (Extra notice helps!)
- Find someone to cover anything that needs covering while you're out and communicate what they need to take over the responsibilities as well as who to refer to for help (e.g., meetings, planned tasks, unfinished business, important Slack/email threads, anything where someone might be depending on you).
- Mark an all-day "Out of office" event in Google Calendar for the day(s) you're taking off or for the hours that you will be off if less than a day. Google Calendar recognizes the event title "OOO" and will give you the option to decline existing and new meetings or just new meetings. You are expected to attend any meetings that you have accepted, so be sure to decline meetings you are not going to attend.
- If you can’t complete these steps because you need to take the day off quickly due to an emergency, let your manager know and they will help you complete the handoff.
- If you ever want to take a day off, and the only thing stopping you is internal (Fleetie-only) meetings, don’t stress. Consider, “Is this a meeting that I can reschedule to another day, or is this a meeting that can go on without me and not interfere with the company’s plans?” Talk to your manager if you’re unsure, but it is perfectly OK to reschedule internal meetings that can wait so that you can take a day off.
- This process is the same for any days you take off, whether it's a holiday or you just need a break.

   
#### Holidays
At Fleet, we have team members with various employment classifications in many different countries worldwide. Fleet is a US company, but we think you should choose the days you want to work and what days you are on holiday, rather than being locked into any particular nation or culture's expectation about when to take time off.
When a team member joins Fleet, they pick one of the following holiday schedules:
 - **Traditional**: This is based on the country where you work. Non-US team members should let their managers know the dates of national holidays.
 **Or**
 - **Freestyle**: You have no set schedule and start with no holidays. Then you add the days that are holidays to you.

Either way, it's up to you to make sure that your responsibilities are covered, and that your team knows you're out of the office.

#### New parent leave
Fleet gives new parents six weeks of paid leave. After six weeks, if you don't feel ready to return yet, we'll set up a quick call to discuss and work together to come up with a plan to help you return to work gradually or when you're ready.

### Retirement contributions

#### US based team members
Commencing in August 2023, Fleet offers the ability for US based team members to contribute to a 401(k) retirement plan directly from their salary. Team members will be auto-enrolled in our plan with Guideline at a default 1% contribution unless they opt out or change their contribution amount within 30 days of commencement. Fleet currently does not match any contributions made by team members to 401(k) plans.

#### Non-US team members
Fleet meets the relevant country's retirement contribution requirements for team members outside the US.

### Coworking
Your Brex card may be used for up to $500 USD per month in coworking costs. Please get prior approval by making a [custom request to the business operations team](#intake).

## Compensation
Compensation at Fleet is determined by benchmarking using [Pave](https://pave.com). Annual raises are not guaranteed, instead we ensure teammates are compensated fairly based on the role, experience, location, and performance relative to benchmarks.

### Payroll dates
US based Fleeties get paid on the last business day of the month. International teammates pay dates follow the same structure as US pay, unless there are in-country requirement that dictate a more frequent cadence.

### Compensation changes
Fleet evaluates and (if necessary) updates compensation decisions yearly, shortly after the anniversary of a team member's start date. The process for that evaluation and update is:
- On the first Friday of the month, the Head of BizOps posts in the `#help-classified` channel with the list of teammates celebrating anniversaries over the next month.
- On the day of the fleetiversary, the Head of BizOps or executive team member will post in `#random` celebrating the tenure of the teammate.
- The Head of BizOps confers with manager or head of department and prepares compensation benchmarking data and schedules time with the CEO and CTO over an existing 1:1 to discuss if an adjustment needs to be made to compensation.
- During the 1:1 call, founders review benchmarking for role and geography, and decide if there will be an adjustment.
- Head of BizOps posts to slack in `#help-classified` with the decision on compensation changes and effective date, if any.
- If a change is to be made, the Head of BizOps communicates decision to the teammate's people manager, who then communicates to their teammate.
- Head of BizOps updates the respective payroll platform (Gusto or Plane) and [equity spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_GJlqnWWIQBiZFOoyl9YbTr72bg5qdSSp4O3kuKm1Jc/edit?usp=sharing) (internal doc).
- If an additional equity grant is part of this compensation change, the previous equity and new situation is noted in detail in the "Notes" column of the equity plan, and the "Grant started?" column is set back to "todo" to add it to the queue for the next time grants are processed (quarterly).


## Relocating
When Fleeties relocate, there are vendors that need to be notified of the change. 

Before relocating, please [let the company know in advance](#intake) by following the directions listed in the relevant issue template ("Moving").


### Equipment

##### Purchasing a company-issued device
Fleet provides laptops for core team members to use while working at Fleet. As soon as an offer is accepted, Business Operations will reach out to the new team member to start this process and will work with the new team member to get their laptop purchased and shipped to them on time.

Apple computers shipping to the United States and Canada are ordered using the Apple [eCommerce Portal](https://ecommerce2.apple.com/asb2bstorefront/asb2b/en/USD/?accountselected=true), or by contacting the business team at an Apple Store or contacting the online sales team at [800-854-3680](tel:18008543680). The business team can arrange for same-day pickup at a store local to the Fleetie if needed.

When ordering through the Apple eCommerce Portal, look for a banner with *Apple Store for FLEET DEVICE MANAGEMENT | Welcome [Your Name].* Hovering over *Welcome* should display *Your Profile.* If Fleet's account number is displayed, purchases will be automatically made available in Apple Business Manager (ABM).

Apple computers for Fleeties in other countries should be purchased through an authorized reseller to ensure the device is enrolled in ADE. In countries that Apple does not operate or that do not allow ADE, work with the authorized reseller to find the best solution, or consider shipping to a US based Fleetie and then shipping on to the teammate. 

##### Selecting a laptop
Most Fleeties use 16-inch MacBook Pros. Team members are free to choose any laptop or operating system that works for them, as long as the price [is within reason](#spending-company-money) and supported by our device management solution.  (Good news: Since Fleet uses Fleet for device management, every operating system is supported!)

When selecting a new laptop for a team member, optimize their configuration to:
1. Have a reasonably large storage (at least 512GB of storage, and if there's any concern go bigger)
2. Look for pre-configured models with the desired memory and storage requirements. These tend to be available for delivery or pickup as quickly as possible and before the start date.

> If delivery timelines are a concern with no devices in stock, play around with build until it ships as quickly as possible.  Sometimes small changes lead to much faster ship times.  More standard configurations (with fewer customizations) usually ship more quickly.  Sometimes MacBook Pros ship more quickly than MacBook Airs, and vice versa.  This varies.  Remember: Always play around with the build and optimize for something that will **ship quickly**!

For example, someone in sales, marketing, or business operations might like to use a 14-inch Macbook Air, whereas someone in an engineering, product, or design role might use a 16-inch MacBook Pro.  **Default to a 16-inch MacBook Pro.**

> A 3-year AppleCare+ Protection Plan (APP) should be considered default for Apple computers >$1500. Base MacBook Airs, Mac minis, etc. do not need APP unless configured beyond the $1500 price point. APP provides 24/7 support, and global repair coverage in case of accidental screen damage or liquid spill, and battery service.

Windows and Linux devices are available upon request for team members in product and engineering.  (See [Buying other new equipment](#buying-other-new-equipment).)

#### Buying other new equipment
At Fleet, we [spend company money like it's our own money](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/business-operations#spending-company-money).  If you need equipment above and beyond those standard guidelines, you can request new equipment by creating a GitHub issue in fleetdm/fleet and attaching the `#g-business-operations`.  Please include a link to the requested equipment (including any specs), the reason for the request, and a timeline for when the device is needed. 

#### Tracking equipment
When a device has been purchased, it's added to the [spreadsheet of company equipment](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hFlymLlRWIaWeVh14IRz03yE-ytBLfUaqVz0VVmmoGI/edit#gid=0) where we keep track of devices and equipment, purchased by Fleet.

When you receive your new computer, complete the entry by adding a description, model, and serial number to the spreadsheet.

#### Returning equipment
Equipment should be returned once offboarded for reprovisioning. Coordinate offboarding and return with the Head of Business Operations. 

#### Reprovisioning equipment
Apple computers with remaining AppleCare Protection Plans should be reprovisioned to other Fleeties who may have older or less-capable computers.

#### Equipment retention and replacement
Older equipment results in lost productivity of Fleeties and should be considered for replacement. Replacement candidates are computers that are no longer under an AppleCare+ Protection Plan (or another warranty plan), are >3 years from the [discontinued date](https://everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook_pro/index-macbookpro.html#specs), or when the "Battery condition" status in Fleet is less than "Normal". The old equipment should be evaluated for return or retention as a test environment.

> If your Apple device is less than 3 years old, has normal battery condition, but is experiencing operating difficulties, you should first contact Apple support and troubleshoot performance issues before requesting a new device.


## Team member onboarding

### Before the start date

Fleet is open source and anyone can contribute at any time.  Before a core team member's start date, they are welcome to contribute, but not expected to.

#### Recommendations for new teammates
Welcome to Fleet!

1. Understand the company
2. Take the time to get trained
3. Get comfortable with the tools
4. Immerse yourself in the world of device management and cybersecurity.

> Please see Fleet's ["🥽 Recommendations for new teammates"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xcnqKB9HHPd94POnZ_7LATiy_VjO2kJdbYx0SAgKVao/edit#).

### Training expectations
It's [important](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/why-this-way#why-the-emphasis-on-training) that every team member at Fleet takes the time to get fully trained and onboarded. 
When a new team member joins Fleet, we create an onboarding issue for them in the [fleetdm/confidential](https://github.com/fleetdm/confidential) repo using this [issue template](https://github.com/fleetdm/confidential/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/onboarding.md). 
We want to make sure that the new team member will be able to complete every task in their issue. To make sure the new team member is successful in their onboarding, we customize their issue by commenting on any tasks they won't need to complete.
We believe in taking onboarding and training seriously and that the onboarding template is an essential source of truth and good use of time for every single new hire. If managers see a step that they don't feel is necessary, they should make a pull request to the [onboarding template](https://github.com/fleetdm/confidential/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/onboarding.md).

Expectations during onboarding:
- Onboarding time (all checkboxes checked) is a KPI for the business operations team.  Our goal is 14 days or less.
- The first 3 weekdays (excluding days off) for **every new team member** at Fleet is reserved for completing onboarding tasks from the checkboxes in their onboarding issue.  New team members **should not work on anything else during this time**, whether or not other tasks are stacking up or assigned.  It is OK, expected, and appreciated for new team members to **remind their manager and colleagues** of this [important](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/why-this-way#why-the-emphasis-on-training) responsibility.
- Even after the first 3 days, during the rest of their first 2 weeks, completing onboarding tasks on time is a new team member's [highest priority](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/why-this-way#why-the-emphasis-on-training).

### Sightseeing tour
During their first day at Fleet, new team members join a sightseeing tour call with the acting Head of People (CEO). During this call, the new team member will participate in an interactive tour of the seven main attractions in our all-remote company, including the primary tools used company-wide, what the human experience is like, and when/why we use them at Fleet.

In this meeting, we'll take a look at:
- Handbook: values, purpose, key pages to pay special attention to
- GitHub issues: the living bloodstream of the company.
- Kanban boards: the bulletin board of quests you can get and how you update status and let folks know things are done.
- Google Calendar: the future.
- Gmail: like any mailbox, full of junk mail, plus some important things, so it is important to check carefully.
- Salesforce: the Rolodex.
- Google Docs: the archives.
- Slack:
  - The "office" (#g-, #general).
  - The walkie talkies (DMs).
  - The watering hole (#oooh-, #random, #news, #help-).

### Contributor experience training
During their first week at Fleet, every new team member schedules a contributor experience training call with the acting Head of People (CEO). During this call, the new team member will share their screen, and the acting Head of People will:
- make sure emails will get seen and responded to quickly.
- make sure Slack messages will get seen and responded to quickly.
- make sure you know where your issues are tracked, which kanban board you use, and what the columns mean.
- make sure you can succeed with submitting a PR with the GitHub web editor, modifying docs or handbook, and working with Markdown.
- talk about Google calendar.
- give you a quick tour of the Fleet Google drive folder.

<!-- 
TODO: Merge this commented-out stuff with the above

Agenda:
A 60-minute call with Mike where you will share your screen, and she will work with you to...
Make sure Slack messages are going to get seen and responded to quickly and disable email notifications in Slack
Make sure you know where your issues are tracked, which kanban board you use, what the columns mean
Make sure you can succeed with submitting a PR in github.com, modifying docs or handbook, working with Markdown
Make sure emails are going to get seen and responded to quickly (make sure inbox management is going to be productive, talk about filters, unsubscribe)
Make sure you know how to see and subscribe to other team members' calendars and that you can add yourself to an event on someone else's calendar.
A quick tour of the Google drive folder (access look correct? Ok. Give access to executed documents on the shared drive as needed) show how to use “Add to drive” or “favorite,” or just a browser bookmark, so the folder is easily accessible. This is where things go. It's the archive.)
Make sure you know how to share a google doc into the folder for all fleeties to see and access.
A high level overview of the Company values
-->

### Onboarding retrospective
At the end of their first two weeks of onboarding at Fleet, every new team member schedules a onboarding retro call with the acting Head of People (CEO).  Agenda: 
> Welcome once again to the team! Please tell me about your first few weeks at Fleet. How did your onboarding/training go? What didn't you manage to get to? Anything you weren't sure how to do? Any feedback on how we can make the experience better for Fleet's next hire?

Fleet prioritizes a [bias for action](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company#ownership).  If possible, apply onboarding feedback to the handbook and issue templates in realtime, during this call.  This avoids backlogging tasks that may just get out of date before we get around to them anyway.





## Github

### GitHub labels

We use special characters to define different types of GitHub labels. By combining labels, we
organize and categorize GitHub issues. This reduces the total number of labels required while
maintaining an expressive labeling system. For example, instead of a label called
`platform-dev-backend`, we use `#platform :dev ~backend`.

| Special character | Label type  | Examples                            |
|:------------------|:------------|:------------------------------------|
| `#`               | Noun        | `#platform`, `#interface`, `#agent`
| `:`               | Verb        | `:dev`, `:research`, `:design`
| `~`               | Adjective   | `~blocked`, `~frontend`, `~backend`


## Zoom

We use [Zoom](https://zoom.us) for virtual meetings at Fleet, and it is important that every team member feels comfortable hosting, joining, and scheduling Zoom meetings.
By default, Zoom settings are the same for all Fleet team members, but you can change your personal settings on your [profile settings](https://zoom.us/profile/setting) page. 
Settings that have a lock icon next to them have been locked by an administrator and cannot be changed. Zoom administrators can change settings for all team members on the [account settings page](https://zoom.us/account/setting) or for individual accounts on the [user management page](https://zoom.us/account/user#/).


## Slack

At Fleet, we do not send internal emails to each other. Instead, we prefer to use [Slack](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/remote-work-how-set-boundaries-when-office-your-house-lora-vaughn/) to communicate with other folks who work at Fleet.
We use threads in Slack as much as possible. Threads help limit noise for other people following the channel and reduce notification overload.
We configure our [working hours in Slack](https://slack.com/help/articles/360025054173-Set-up-Slack-for-work-hours-) to make sure everyone knows when they can get in touch with others.

### Slack channel prefixes
We have specific channels for various topics, but we also have more general channels for the teams at Fleet.
We use these prefixes to organize the Fleet Slack:
 * ***g-***: for team/group channels *(Note: "g-" is short for "grupo" or "group")*.

#### Slack communications and best practices
In consideration of our team, Fleet avoids using global tags in channels (i.e. @here, @channel, etc). 
      1. What about polls? Good question, Fleeties are asked to post their poll in the channel and @mention the teammates they would like to hear from. 
      2. Why does this matter? Great question! The Fleet [culture](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company#culture) is pretty simple: think of others, and remember the company [Values](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company#values).




## Levels of confidentiality

- *Public*   _(share with anyone, anywhere in the world)_
- *Confidential*  _(share only with team members who've signed an NDA, consulting agreement, or employment agreement)_
- *Classified*  _(share only with founders of Fleet, business operations, and/or the people involved.  e.g., US social security numbers during hiring)_
