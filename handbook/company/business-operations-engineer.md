#  🔦 Business Operations Engineer

## Let's start with why we exist. 📡

Ever wondered if your employer is monitoring your work computer?

Organizations make huge investments every year to keep their laptops and servers online, secure, compliant, and usable from anywhere. This is called "device management".

At Fleet, we think it's time device management became [transparent](https://fleetdm.com/transparency) and [open source](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company#open-source).
