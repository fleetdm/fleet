# TODO figure out what to do with this other quote that both Austin and Dre :+1:'d: "Fleet lets us be more actionable with fewer people. It helps us to filter out the noise better than we could with the other big name products we replaced."
-
  quote: The visibility down into the assets covered by the agent is phenomenal. Fleet has become the central source for a lot of things.

  quote: Keeping up with the latest issues in endpoint security is a never-ending task, because engineers have to regularly ensure every laptop and server is still sufficiently patched and securely configured. The problem is, software vendors release new versions all the time, and no matter how much you lock it down, end users find ways to change things.

  quote: One of the big reasons why I always support open source products with a commercial-backed company is the limitless capabilities and freedom to fully take advantage of the product.  With vmware ONE being acquired by Broadcom, it makes more sense to migrate to an open platform that gives you product freedom to manage your device fleet and rely on the community for new ideas.

  quote: Fleet has such a huge amount of use cases. My goal was to get telemetry on endpoints, but then our IR team, our TBM team, and multiple other folks in security started heavily utilizing the system in ways I didn’t expect. It spread so naturally, even our corporate and infrastructure teams want to run it.
