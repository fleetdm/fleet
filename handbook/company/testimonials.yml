# TODO figure out what to do with this other quote that both Austin and Dre :+1:'d: "Fleet lets us be more actionable with fewer people. It helps us to filter out the noise better than we could with the other big name products we replaced."

  quote: I had to answer some really complex questions for a compliance audit, and I was able to do it in about 15 minutes by munging some data together via a few queries into a csv. It took me longer to remember how to use `xsv` than to actually put together the report. If you aren't using osquery in your environment, you should be.

  quote: Keeping up with the latest issues in endpoint security is a never-ending task, because engineers have to regularly ensure every laptop and server is still sufficiently patched and securely configured. The problem is, software vendors release new versions all the time, and no matter how much you lock it down, end users find ways to change things.

  quote: Fleet has such a huge amount of use cases. My goal was to get telemetry on endpoints, but then our IR team, our TBM team, and multiple other folks in security started heavily utilizing the system in ways I didn’t expect. It spread so naturally, even our corporate and infrastructure teams want to run it.
