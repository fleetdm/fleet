  quote: Fleet's extremely wide and diverse set of data allows us to answer questions that we didn't even know we had.  On top of that, the experience is near instantaneous.  Seconds to sort through billions of data points and return the exact handful that we need, with complete auditing and transparency.  We're able to address reliability and compliance concerns without sacrificing a single point-of-a-percent of performance for our servers.  All of this done consistently and continuously.

  quote: Keeping up with the latest issues in endpoint security is a never-ending task, because engineers have to regularly ensure every laptop and server is still sufficiently patched and securely configured. The problem is, software vendors release new versions all the time, and no matter how much you lock it down, end users find ways to change things.

  quote: I had to answer some really complex questions for a compliance audit, and I was able to do it in about 15 minutes by munging some data together via a few queries into a csv. It took me longer to remember how to use `xsv` than to actually put together the report. If you aren't using osquery in your environment, you should be.

  quote: Fleet has such a huge amount of use cases. My goal was to get telemetry on endpoints, but then our IR team, our TBM team, and multiple other folks in security started heavily utilizing the system in ways I didn’t expect. It spread so naturally, even our corporate and infrastructure teams want to run it.
