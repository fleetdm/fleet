# 🧭 Product maturity assessment

Fleet provides comprehensive device management across the entire computing lifecycle, from enrollment through configuration, monitoring, maintenance, and offboarding. As we continue to evolve and expand our capabilities, different stages and features are at varying levels of maturity. This assessment provides transparency into Fleet's current state and roadmap, helping customers, prospects, and internal teams understand where we excel today and where we're investing for the future. We use a structured maturity framework that evaluates both individual categories (specific features and capabilities) and overall stages (major lifecycle areas) to give a clear picture of Fleet's product maturity.

## Maturity legend

**Category maturity**

- 🥚 **Planned**: Not yet implemented in Fleet, but on our roadmap
- 🐣 **Minimal**: A minimal foundation so people can see where we're going and to validate customer need
- 🐥 **Viable**: Used by customers to solve real problems
- 🦆 **Complete**: Contains a competitive feature set sufficient to displace other device management tools
- 🦢 **Lovable**: Provides an elevated experience that customers love

**Stage lifecycle**

- Early Development (most categories Planned/Minimal)
- Core Capabilities Available (key platforms/categories Viable)
- Enterprise Ready (majority Viable/Complete, competitive feature set)
- Market Competitive (Complete across all major use cases)
- Market Leading (Lovable in key areas, Complete elsewhere)

## Planned category maturity

The maturity framework makes it easy to visualize where Fleet is making investments and resulting category maturity improvements. As part of the planning process for each category, the set of features required and expected date to reach the next maturity is maintained.

---

## How to fill out and maintain this page

Use this guide to keep assessments consistent and up to date. Updates are typically made quarterly and when major features ship.

### Maturity levels (per category)

- 🥚 Planned: Not yet implemented, but on Fleet's roadmap
- 🐣 Minimal: Basic foundation, validating customer need
- 🐥 Viable: Used by customers in production to solve real problems
- 🦆 Complete: Competitive feature set that can replace competitors
- 🦢 Lovable: Elevated experience that customers love (e.g., NPS/surveys)

When deciding a category's maturity, ask:

1. Is it shipped? If not, it's Planned
2. Is it used in production? If yes, at least Viable
3. Does it match leading competitors? If yes, Complete
4. Do customers praise the experience? If yes, Lovable

### Stage lifecycle (per stage)

Choose the best description for the stage overall based on the mix of category maturities:

- Early Development (most categories Planned/Minimal)
- Core Capabilities Available (key platforms/categories Viable)
- Enterprise Ready (majority Viable/Complete, competitive feature set)
- Market Competitive (Complete across all major use cases)
- Market Leading (Lovable in key areas, Complete elsewhere)

Replace placeholders with the current assessment. Look at the overall mix of category maturities in the stage to determine the appropriate lifecycle stage.

### What to include in each stage section

1. Stage lifecycle: Replace the placeholder with the current stage-level assessment
2. Analyst reports: Add any relevant mentions (optional)
3. Category maturity table: For each category row, set Current maturity (emoji only) and projections for future quarters (Q1–Q4)
   - Category name: Include a link to Fleet documentation if available, or plain text if not
   - Maturity columns: Use only emojis (🥚 🐣 🐥 🦆 🦢) without text labels

Example row transformation:

- Before: `| DEP/ABM enrollment |  |  |  |  |  |`
- After:  `| [DEP/ABM enrollment (Apple)](https://fleetdm.com/guides/apple-mdm-setup#apple-business-manager-abm) | 🦆 | 🦆 | 🦆 | 🦆 | 🦆 |`

This indicates: Current maturity is Complete (🦆), with Complete maintained across all quarters.

### Tips for projections

- Be realistic; don't overpromise
- Show progress; gradually advance maturity levels
- Consider dependencies; some categories need others to mature first
- Align with Fleet's public roadmap and release plans
- Not everything must advance each quarter

Common patterns:

- Rapid maturation: 🥚 → 🐣 → 🐥 → 🦆 → 🦢
- Steady improvement: 🐥 → 🐥 → 🦆 → 🦆 → 🦢
- Maintenance mode: 🦆 → 🦆 → 🦆 → 🦢 → 🦢
- Already excellent: 🦢 → 🦢 → 🦢 → 🦢 → 🦢

### Quarterly review checklist

1. Advance categories that met goals; adjust projections as needed
2. Update stage lifecycle if overall maturity improved based on category changes
3. Review and update category names to reflect current naming conventions
4. Update the "Last updated" date in your PR description

### Governance

- Internal review: Product design and engineering to validate assessments
- Consistency: Ensure projections align with public roadmap and release plans
- Transparency: Avoid commitments that create legal obligations; treat projections as targets
