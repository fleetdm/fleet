### Who is your information shared with?

We may share each of the categories of personal information we collect with the types of third parties described below, for the following business purposes:

* ***Sharing with managed accounts and administrators:*** If you have created a Fleet account with your corporate email address, we may share your personal information with your Company if your Company enters into a commercial relationship with Fleet. If this happens, then your use of the software and your account is subject to the terms and any data protection agreement between your Company and Fleet.

These are companies who provide services on our behalf, such as hosting our Services, marketing, advertising, social, analytics, support ticketing, credit card processing, security and other such similar services. These companies are subject to contractual requirements that govern the security and confidentiality of your information.  
* For example, we use analytics providers, such as Pendo and Google Analytics, to help us understand the operation and performance of our Services. To learn about how Google uses and shares data it collects through its services, please visit [https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/).

* ***Sharing with partners and resellers:*** Fleet works with third parties who provide sales, consulting, support and technical services for our Services. Where permitted and with your consent (if required), we may share your data with these partners and resellers.  
* ***Sharing with affiliated companies:*** Fleet will share information collected with [companies owned and operated by us](http://fleetdm.com/handbook/company).  
* ***Sharing for fraud and prevention abuse:*** We may share your information when we have a good faith belief that the disclosure is necessary to prevent fraud, abuse of our services, defend against attacks, and to protect the safety of Fleet and our users.  
* ***Law enforcement:*** Fleet may disclose personal information or other information we collect about you to law enforcement if required in response to a valid subpoena, court order, search warrant, a similar government order, or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to protect our property or rights, or those of third parties or the public at large.  
* ***Merger or acquisition:*** We may share your personal information if we are involved in a merger, sale, or acquisition of corporate entities or business units. If any such change of ownership happens, we will ensure that it is under terms that preserve the confidentiality of your personal information, and we will notify you on our website or by email before any transfer of your personal information.

### Is your personal information transferred across national borders?

Our Services are hosted in the United States and information we collect will be stored and processed on our servers in the United States. Our employees, contractors, affiliated organizations and processors that process personal information may be located in the United States or other countries outside of your home country. If you reside in the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, or Switzerland, and we transfer information about you to a jurisdiction that has not been found by the European Commission to have adequate data protections, we will use available safeguards and legal mechanisms to help ensure your rights and protections, including using Standard Contractual Clauses or obtaining your consent.

### Security

We work hard to protect your personal information. We employ administrative, technical, and physical security controls where appropriate, to protect your information. For more information on our security practices please see: [Fleet Security](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/security).

### Data retention

Fleet will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to perform our contractual obligations, provide you the Services, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, preserve legal rights, or enforce our agreements.

We may delete inactive accounts and associated projects and repositories after a period of twelve (12) months.

## Rights and choices

You have the right to access, correct, restrict or delete your personal information, and to port your personal information to another company. While these rights may vary by jurisdiction, Fleet provides you with the same rights and choices, no matter where you live.

You may exercise your choices and rights as follows:

* ***To opt out of email marketing:*** You may opt-out of email marketing by clicking the “unsubscribe” link located at the bottom of any email you receive. You may continue to receive transactional email messages about your account and the Service after you have unsubscribed.  
* ***To opt-out of interest-based advertising:*** If you wish to opt-out of interest-based advertising, please visit the Cookie Policy to see your options.  
* ***Request a copy of your information:*** You may [request a copy of the personal information](https://fleetdm.com/company/contact) that Fleet has about you.  
* ***Update your information:*** If you already have an account, you may access, update, or alter your user profile information by logging into your account and updating profile settings.  
* ***To delete your account:*** You may delete your account by logging into your account and going to the “Delete my Account” option in your profile settings.  
* Please note that due to the open source nature of our Services, we may retain limited personal information indefinitely in order to provide a transactional history. For example, if you provide your information in connection with a blog post or comment, we may display that information even if you have deleted your account as we do not automatically delete community posts. Also, if you contribute to a public project (not owned by Fleet), and you provide your personal information in connection with that contribution, your personal information will be embedded and publicly displayed with your contribution, and we will not be able to delete or erase it because doing so would break the project.  
* If you contribute to Fleet by commenting in GitHub, or creating an issue or merge request and you provide your personal information in connection with that contribution, your personal information associated with your contribution will be deleted and attributed to a ghost user. However, please note that if the content of the contribution contains personal information, this information would remain and you will need to submit a specific request to have this information deleted.  
* To port your profile information, you may use the [API](https://fleetdm.com/docs/using-fleet/rest-api).

### California privacy rights

Under the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) you are entitled to certain rights such as access to your specific personal information, details about our processing of your personal information, and the right to delete your information. You may exercise all of these rights as described in the “Your Rights and Choices” section. Fleet does not sell your personal information, as defined under CCPA, and has not done so for the past 12 months.

You may designate, in writing or through a power of attorney, an authorized agent to make requests on your behalf to exercise your rights under the CCPA. Before accepting such a request from an agent, we will require the agent to provide proof you have authorized it to act on your behalf, and we may need you to verify your identity directly with us. To provide or delete specific pieces of personal information we will need to verify your identity to the degree of certainty required by law. 

### Information Fleet does not collect

Fleet does not intentionally collect sensitive personal information, such as social security numbers, genetic data, health information, or religious information. Although Fleet does not request or intentionally collect any sensitive personal information, we realize that users might store this kind of information in a Fleet repository. If you are a child under the age of 13, you may not have an account. Fleet does not knowingly collect information from, or direct any of our Services to, children under 13\. If we learn or have reason to suspect that a user is under the age of 13, we will close the child’s account.

### Policy changes

Fleet may change its Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will update the date at the top of this Policy. If we decide to make a significant change to our Privacy Policy, we will post a notice of the update on the homepage of our Website. We may also provide notification via email of any material changes to our Privacy Policy.
