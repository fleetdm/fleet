## How to submit an article

1. Familiarize yourself with our [article formatting guide](./article-formatting-guide) and writing style guide (todo).
2. Create a pull request for fleetdm.com with a file of your article, formatted in [Markdown](./markdown-guide).
3. Include any relevant images, image suggestions, or other design requests you may have.

> **IMPORTANT**: Your PR is not confidential. If the information in your article is confidential, please prepare your article in a Google Doc, or create a draft PR ~1 hour before publication time to keep your article private.

## Review process

Articles are official Fleet communication. We carefully review published content to make sure Fleet, the company and the product, are accurately represented.

- Digital Experience will review your article for spelling, punctuation, and grammar, as well as for tone and brand consistency. 
- In some cases, a technical review by a member of Engineering or Security may be necessary. 
- After review, you may be asked to make revisions to your draft.

### Typical editing timelines are as follows:

| Type | Review time |
|:-----|:------------|
| Urgent posts |One business day |
| Non-urgent posts | Three business days | 
| Posts requiring a technical review | Three business days |

> Review times for posts requiring a technical review may vary depending on the Engineering and Security teams' schedules. E.g., if a review coincides with a product release.

## Pre-publication checklist

- Does the article meet the original brief and keyword goals?
- Has the article been reviewed by Digital Experience for grammar edits and brand consistency?
- Does the article require a technical review?
- Do all links work correctly and open in a new window?
- Does the article contain the correct [meta tags](./article-formatting-guide.md#meta-tags)
- Has artwork been created by Digital Experience?
- Does the article have a clear [call to action (CTA)](./article-formatting-guide.md#customizable-cta)?

## After publication

After your article is published, the Growth team will schedule your post to be promoted across our social media channels.

> Consider promoting your article on your personal channels to help achieve a bigger impact. Depending on the article, the Growth team may make a request in [#help-promote](https://fleetdm.slack.com/archives/C026W5TC10V) on Slack.
