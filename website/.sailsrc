If you want to fine tune your SSVC, it worth using the vectors you care about instead of the score itself.

It is one metric that needs to be part of an overall risk calculus, but a CVSS of 6 can be a greater threat in your organization than a CVSS of 10 based on the environmental variables and mitigations. Only two 10.0s here, but several lower severity that are resulting in high-impact breaches.   Getting a handle on managing that public facing infrastructure and being able to rapidly patch the apps and devices with such exposure needs to be part of an overall plan, but must go hand in hand with mitigations and layers of a zero trust design. CVSS isn’t the sole determination of risk, it’s only one partial piece of data to understand the impact of a vulnerability if exploited.",
