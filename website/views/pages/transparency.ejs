This is not a feature designed for privacy invasion, but rather a means for security teams to locate files on your device that may have been created or affected by a malicious virus.<br/><br/>
            Additionally, Fleet can be configured to store disk encryption keys that can be used to recover encrypted data from a macOS device.
