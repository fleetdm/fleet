          <h5>Declarative device management</h5>
          <p>Most device management solutions have an API, but most do not provide comprehensive control over the admin console with configuration-as-code like Fleet.</p>
          <p>Managing the Fleet UI console with infrastructure as code means you have total declarative control over your devices.</p>
          <p>Unlock powerful automations that allow you to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Ensure every change is peer-reviewed</li>
            <li>Ensure every setting is version-controlled</li>
            <li>Easily roll back to a previous state</li>
            <li>Declare the state of the Fleet UI in code, continuously</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div purpose="feature">
          <h5>Observable, reversible, and repeatable workflows</h5>
          <p>Nothing builds knowledge, trust, and fosters engineering teamwork like peer-reviewed changes made in the open.</p>
          <p>Collaboration on infrastructure as code workflows helps to prevent problems before they occur. Version control means it is straightforward to fix problems that do make it into production (nobody's perfect...)</p>
          <p>Another powerful technical benefit: less effort on long-term maintenance. Controlling the Fleet UI with code results in a library of stable, known-good configurations that can be copied and modified to easily add new management objects, like device profiles and software. Tame the endless sprawl of manually re-creating automations and scoping.</p>

          <p>Infrastructure as code opens device management to the whole organization. Engineers, security, and ops can all propose changes — while an expert from IT reviews and approves every update before it ships. Collaboration without chaos.</p>
          <h5>GitOps is the foundation for AI-accelerated device management</h5>
          <p>Without GitOps there is no way to do AI-accelerated device management. With GitOps you can take advantage of the modern tools your org is already pushing, and keep IT from being left behind as a cost center.</p>
          <h5>Reduce friction, skip the ticket queue</h5>
          <p>Iterate more quickly by reducing friction and hand-offs. Instead of ticket queues, easily propose changes with natural language.* Use any LLM — even airgapped — and easily integrate tools like <a href="https://kilo.ai" target="_blank">Kilocode</a> that work with Slack and Microsoft Teams.</p>

          <h5>Your culture matters, and so does ours</h5>
          <p>For some organizations, infrastructure as code is a natural fit to the engineering culture even if IT teams lack experience or the practice is new.</p>

          <p>If DevOps or GitOps is already used by an organization, device management engineers may be aware of the concepts and tooling. Having an internal example to follow can result in an easier path to adoption.</p>

          <p>But, adoption is not always simple. Admins may resist unfamiliar workflows or solutions. They may also have concerns about losing the value of certifications or specialized training.</p>
          <p>By meeting potential challenges with phased implementation and thought leadership, any team can successfully adopt infrastructure as code for device management. We've seen it, and we've helped our customers do it.</p>

        <div purpose="feature">
          <h5>Making infrastructure as code benefits real</h5>
          <p>At Fleet, we believe that showing organizations how to migrate to infrastructure as code workflows represents an enormous opportunity for them to increase engineering efficiency and operational speed. This ultimately improves both end user experience and enterprise compliance. We design the product around these goals. We want to help you achieve them.</p>
          <p>One way we can help is by improving the product itself, which we're doing every day.</p>
          <p>Another way we can help is through training. To learn more about managing devices with infrastructure as code, you can attend one of our free, hands-on, in-person <a href="/gitops-workshop">GitOps workshops</a>, or you can request that one be delivered in your area.</p>
