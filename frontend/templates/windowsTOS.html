                  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Fleet

                No Warranties<br />
                <p>
                  To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Fleet
                  expressly disclaims any warranty for the Software Product. The
                  Software Product and any related documentation are provided
                  "as is" without warranty of any kind, either express or
                  implied, including, without limitation, the implied warranties
                  of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. Fleet
                  makes no warranty that the Software Product will meet your
                  requirements or operate under your specific conditions of use.
                  Fleet makes no warranty that operation of the Software Product
                  will be secure, error free, or free from interruption. The
                  entire risk arising out of use or performance of the Software

                No Liability for Consequential Damages<br />
                <p>
                  To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event
                  shall Fleet, its directors, officers, employees, agents or its
                  suppliers be liable for any damages whatsoever (including,
                  without limitation, damages for loss of business profit,
                  business interruption, loss of business information, or any
                  other pecuniary loss) arising out of the use of, or inability
                  to use, this Fleet product, even if Fleet has been advised of
                  the possibility of such damages. Because some
                  states/jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation
                  of liability for consequential or incidental damages, the
                  above limitation may not apply to you.

                  Your remedy for a breach of this Agreement or of any warranty
                  included in this Agreement is the correction or replacement of
                  the Software Product. Selection of whether to correct or
                  replace shall be solely at the discretion of Fleet. If Fleet
                  is unable to provide a replacement or substitute Software
                  Product or corrections to the Software Product, your sole
                  alternate remedy shall be a refund of the purchase price for
                  the Software Product.

                  in full force and effect. To the extent any express or implied
                  restrictions are not permitted by applicable laws, these
                  express or implied restrictions shall remain in force and
                  effect to the maximum extent permitted by such applicable
