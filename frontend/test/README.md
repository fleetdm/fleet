# Fleet UI tests

The test directory contains the jest configuration, test setup, request handlers, mock server definition,  testing utilities, and entity stubs (deprecated and will be replaced by mocks in `frontend/__mocks__`) for use in test files throughout the application. The test files for components and app functions are located in the same directory as the files they test.

<!-- 
TODO

The default export from the test directory includes mock server with default handlers, custom handlers, testing stubs, and testing utilities like custom renderers. -->

## Jest configuration

This is where the jest configuration is located. Refer to [Jest's official documentation](https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration).
## Test setup

This file configures the testing environment for every test file.

## Request handlers and their setup

Default handlers and custom handlers are both defined within the `handlers` directory and return [mocked data](../__mocks__/README.md). The handlers directory will naturally grow with more default and custom handlers required for more tests. We use [mock service worker](https://mswjs.io/docs/api/rest) to define all request handlers.

Default handlers and custom handlers differ in their setup. Default handlers are setup in [mock-server.ts](./mock-server.ts). The mock server will serve the default handlers outlined in [default-handlers.ts](./default-handlers.ts). Custom handlers must be setup inline within a component's test suite (`frontend/**/ComponentName.tests.tsx`). For example, we would setup the custom handler `activityHandler9Activities` inline using `mockServer.use(activityHandler9Activities);`.

## Testing utilities

We use various utility functions to write our tests.

## Testing stubs `Deprecated`

Testing stubs are still being used in a handful of old tests. We are no longer following this pattern of adding data to testing stubs. Rather, we are building stubs as mocks located in the `frontend/__mocks__` directory.
