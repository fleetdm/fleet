# Seeding data

When developing Fleet, it may be useful to create seed data that includes users and teams.


> In order to run scripts that make use of premium features, make sure you have started the server with the correct flags as described in [Testing](./testing-and-local-development.md#license-key).

Check out this Loom demo video that walks through creating teams seed data:

For a text-based walkthrough, follow these steps:

## Create an environment variable file

First, create an `env` file with the following contents:

```
export SERVER_URL=https://localhost:8080 # your Fleet server URL and port
export CURL_FLAGS='-k -s' # set insecure flag
export TOKEN=eyJhbGciOi... # your api token
```

Conveniently, you can store the `env` file as `fleet_env` in the `./code/fleet-api-env` directory.

## Apply your environment variable file

Next, set the `FLEET_ENV_PATH` to point to the `env` file using the command line.

```
export FLEET_ENV_PATH=./code/fleet-api-env/fleet_env
```

This will let the scripts in the `/tools/api/fleet/` folder source the `env` file.

## Run one of the bash scripts to seed the data

Finally, run one of the bash scripts located in the [/tools/api](../../tools/api) directory.

### Seed free users

The `fleet/create_free` script will generate an environment to roughly reflect an installation of Fleet Free. The script creates three users with different roles.

```
./tools/api/fleet/teams/create_free
```

### Seed premium users

The `fleet/create_premium` script will generate an environment to roughly reflect an installation of Fleet Premium. The script will create two teams of seven users with different roles.

```
./tools/api/fleet/teams/create_premium
```

### Seed designing users

The `fleet/create_figma` script will generate an environment to reflect the mockups in the Fleet EE (current) Figma file. The script creates three teams and twelve users with different roles.

```
./tools/api/fleet/teams/create_figma
```

Each user-generated by the script has its password set to `password123#`.

### Import queries

After seeding users and teams, checkout [importing queries](../using-fleet/standard-query-library#importing-the-queries-in-fleet) from Fleet's [standard query library](https://fleetdm.com/queries).

### Create an API-only user

Like all regular users, seeded users API token expires frequently. For an API token that does not expire, create an [API-only user](../using-fleet/fleetctl-cli#using-fleetctl-with-an-api-only-user)
