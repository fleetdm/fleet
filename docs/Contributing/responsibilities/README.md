# Fleet Responsibilities Documentation

This directory contains responsibility documents for Fleet product groups.

## Product Group Responsibilities

Each product group has its own responsibility documentation:

- [MDM Responsibilities](mdm/) - Responsibility documentation for MDM
- [Orchestration Responsibilities](orchestration/) - Responsibility documentation for Orchestration
- [Software Responsibilities](software/) - Responsibility documentation for Software

## Purpose

Responsibility documents define the scope, ownership, and boundaries of each product group. They help clarify which team is responsible for which parts of the system, reducing overlap and ensuring all aspects of the system are covered.
