# Glossary

## WSTEP

[WSTEP](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-wstep/ac55b8cc-9ade-4982-b135-991d574ade74) is the protocol Microsoft uses to automate certificate requesting and singing. It is similar to the SCEP process used by macOS.

The certificate created through the WSTEP process is used to authenticate mTLS between the host and management endpoint.

## SyncML

[SyncML](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-wstep/ac55b8cc-9ade-4982-b135-991d574ade74) is an XML dialect used by Microsoft for Device Management.

## mTLS

[Mutual Transport Layer Security](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-mutual-tls/) is a method for securing communications between two parties, in which both parties present signed certificates. This is different from standard TLS, where only the most provides a certificate. This allows both parties to authenticate the other's identity.

# Registry

- `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Enrollments\`
  Each enrollment gets its own subdirectory with a UUID as a key,
  inside each directory is a set of keys associated with that enrollment
  - `CurCryptoProvider`
     Often `Microsoft Software Key Storage Provider`
     Cryptographic Key storage provider
  - `CurKeyContainer`
    Key within key provider
  - `DiscoveryServiceFullURL`
    MDM Discovery service URL
  - `DMPCertThumbPrint`
    According to [this blog post](https://call4cloud.nl/2022/10/fullmetal-certificate-the-revenge-of-renewal/), this is the thumbprint of your MDM device certificate
  - `EnrollmentFlags`
    See [this link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-xcep/cd22d3a0-f469-4a44-95ed-d10ce4dc2063) for details

  - `EnrollmentState`
    The best documentation we can find is [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/intune-shared-enrollmentstate?view=graph-rest-beta)

    | blocked      | 5     | Device is enrolled as userless, but is blocked from moving to user enrollment because the app failed to install.   |

  - `EnrollmentType`
    According to [this PDF](https://winprotocoldoc.blob.core.windows.net/productionwindowsarchives/MS-MDE2/%5BMS-MDE2%5D.pdf) it can have three different values.

    Device, Full, and AppManaged

    From what I've seen, value 6 on AAD, 1 on manual
  - `isFederated`
    According to [this web page](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/client-management/federated-authentication-device-enrollment), being federated means that the MDM
    endpoints and details were fetched from a Discovery endpoint,
    instead of being manually installed. The page does not make mention
    of the specific registry key, but we are making an assumption that
    it means the same thing.
  - `ProviderID`
    Set during enrollment. In our case it's the word "Fleet".
  - `RenewalPeriod`
    Set during enrollment. Period to renew WSTEP certificate.
  - `RenewErrorCode`
    Presumably set if there is an error renewing WSTEP certificate.
  - `RenewROBOSupport`
    According to [this post](https://call4cloud.nl/2022/10/fullmetal-certificate-the-revenge-of-renewal/) this means "Request On Behalf Of". 
    It seems to have to do with automatic certificate renewal
  - `RenewStatus`
    Status of the renewal
  - `RenewTimestamp`
    Presumably the timestamp of the last renewal
  - `RootCertThumbPrint`
    The thumbprint of the WSTEP root certificate
  - `SID`
    Security Identifier
  - `UPN`
    User Principal Name of the user that enrolled the device
  - `AADResourceID`
    Appears to be the domain of the server managing the enrollment,
    always appears to be present on machines enrolled through Microsoft
    Entra (Azure Active Directory)
  - `AADTenantID`
    Also related to Azure Active Directory, and also appears to be
    present at the same time as AADResourceID.
- `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Provisioning\Diagnostics\AutoPilot`
  Autopilot provisioning diagnostic data
