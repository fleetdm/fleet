# Vulnerability Management

This document provides an overview of Fleet's Vulnerability Management functionality.

## Introduction

Vulnerability Management in Fleet identifies and manages software vulnerabilities in the device fleet. This includes identifying vulnerable software, assessing severity, and providing remediation recommendations.

## Key Features

### Vulnerability Identification

Fleet identifies vulnerabilities in installed software:

- Comparison of installed software with known vulnerabilities
- Support for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)
- Integration with multiple vulnerability databases
- Regular updates to vulnerability data

### Severity Assessment

Fleet assesses the severity of identified vulnerabilities:

- Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) scores
- Temporal and environmental factors
- Risk-based prioritization
- Custom severity adjustments

### Affected Device Tracking

Fleet tracks devices affected by vulnerabilities:

- List of affected devices for each vulnerability
- Device details and context
- Vulnerability status per device
- Aggregated vulnerability metrics

### Remediation Recommendations

Fleet provides recommendations for remediating vulnerabilities:

- Update recommendations
- Configuration changes
- Workarounds
- Links to vendor advisories

### Reporting and Dashboards

Fleet provides comprehensive reporting and dashboards:

- Vulnerability trends over time
- Top vulnerabilities by severity
- Most affected devices
- Remediation progress

## Implementation

### Vulnerability Data Sources

Fleet uses multiple sources for vulnerability data:

- National Vulnerability Database (NVD)
- Vendor security advisories
- Third-party vulnerability feeds
- Custom vulnerability data

### Vulnerability Matching

Fleet matches installed software with known vulnerabilities:

- Name and version matching
- CPE (Common Platform Enumeration) matching
- Vendor and product name normalization
- Version range comparison

### Vulnerability Scoring

Fleet uses CVSS for vulnerability scoring:

- Base scores from vulnerability databases
- Temporal factors based on availability of patches
- Environmental factors based on device context
- Overall risk calculation

### Remediation Workflow

Fleet supports a remediation workflow for vulnerabilities:

- Identification of remediation actions
- Assignment of remediation tasks
- Tracking of remediation progress
- Verification of successful remediation

## Integration

Vulnerability Management integrates with other Fleet components:

- **Software Inventory**: For identifying installed software
- **Software Updates**: For remediating vulnerabilities through updates
- **Software Policies**: For enforcing vulnerability-related policies
