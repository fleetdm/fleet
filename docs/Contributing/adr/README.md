# Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) for Fleet.

## What are ADRs?

Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) are documents that capture important architectural decisions made along with their context and consequences. They provide a record of architectural decisions that affect the system, the context in which they were made, and the rationale behind them.

## Why use ADRs?

ADRs help teams:
- Document important decisions for future reference
- Communicate the reasoning behind decisions
- Onboard new team members by providing context
- Track the evolution of the system architecture over time

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows a standard format:

1. **Title**: A descriptive title that summarizes the decision
2. **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Rejected, Deprecated, or Superseded
3. **Context**: The context and problem statement that led to this decision
4. **Decision**: The decision that was made
5. **Consequences**: The consequences of the decision, both positive and negative
6. **References**: Any references to related documents or resources

## Creating a New ADR

To create a new ADR:

1. Copy the [template](template.md) to a new file named `NNNN-descriptive-title.md` where `NNNN` is the next number in sequence
2. Fill in the template with your decision
3. Submit a pull request with your new ADR
