# Software Updates Architecture

This document provides an overview of Fleet's Software Updates architecture.

## Introduction

Software Updates in Fleet enables the management and deployment of software updates across the device fleet. This document provides insights into the design decisions, system components, and interactions specific to the Software Updates functionality.

## Architecture Overview

The Software Updates architecture enables the identification, configuration, and deployment of software updates across a fleet of devices. It leverages platform-specific mechanisms to update software on devices.

## Key Components

- **Update Identification**: The identification of available updates for installed software.
- **Update Configuration**: The configuration of update parameters.
- **Update Distribution**: The distribution of update instructions to devices.
- **Update Execution**: The execution of update instructions on devices.
- **Update Reporting**: The reporting of update status and results.

## Update Flow

### 1 - Server Identifies Available Updates

```
Server -> Software Inventory -> Vendor Update Sources
```

1. Server retrieves software inventory information.
2. Server checks for available updates from vendor update sources.
3. Server identifies devices with outdated software.

### 2 - User Configures Update Deployment

```
User -> UI -> Server -> DB
```

1. User configures update deployment through the UI or API.
2. Server stores the update configuration in the database.

### 3 - Server Distributes Update Instructions

```
Server -> Device
```

1. Server sends update instructions to the device.
2. Device receives and validates the instructions.

### 4 - Device Executes Updates

```
Device -> Update Source -> Device
```

1. Device downloads the update.
2. Device installs the update using platform-specific mechanisms.

### 5 - Device Reports Update Status

```
Device -> Server -> DB
```

1. Device reports update status to the server.
2. Server stores the status in the database.
3. Server updates the UI with the status.

## Platform-Specific Implementation

### macOS

On macOS, software updates are performed using:

- **MDM Commands**: For MDM-managed devices, updates are performed using MDM commands.
- **softwareupdate**: For system updates, updates are performed using the `softwareupdate` command.
- **Package Managers**: For package-based software, updates are performed using package managers like Homebrew.

### Windows

On Windows, software updates are performed using:

- **MDM Commands**: For MDM-managed devices, updates are performed using MDM commands.
- **Windows Update**: For system updates, updates are performed using the Windows Update service.
- **PowerShell**: For application updates, updates are performed using PowerShell scripts.

### Linux

On Linux, software updates are performed using:

- **Package Managers**: Updates are performed using package managers like apt, yum, or dnf.
- **Shell Scripts**: For custom updates, updates are performed using shell scripts.

## Update Parameters

Software updates can be configured with various parameters:

- **Target Devices**: The devices on which to apply updates.
- **Update Options**: Options specific to the updates being applied.
- **Scheduling**: When to perform the updates.
- **Retry Logic**: How to handle update failures.
- **Reboot Behavior**: How to handle required reboots.
