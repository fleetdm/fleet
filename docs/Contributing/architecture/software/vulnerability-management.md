# Vulnerability Management Architecture

This document provides an overview of Fleet's Vulnerability Management architecture.

## Introduction

Vulnerability Management in Fleet identifies and manages software vulnerabilities in the device fleet. This document provides insights into the design decisions, system components, and interactions specific to the Vulnerability Management functionality.

## Architecture Overview

The Vulnerability Management architecture enables the identification, tracking, and remediation of software vulnerabilities across a fleet of devices. It compares installed software versions with known vulnerabilities and provides information about affected devices.

## Key Components

- **Vulnerability Identification**: The process of identifying vulnerabilities in installed software.
- **Vulnerability Tracking**: The tracking of vulnerabilities and affected devices.
- **Vulnerability Remediation**: The process of remediating vulnerabilities.
- **Vulnerability Reporting**: The reporting of vulnerability status and metrics.

## Vulnerability Identification Flow

### 1 - Server Retrieves Software Inventory

```
Server -> DB
```

1. Server retrieves software inventory information from the database.

### 2 - Server Compares Software with Vulnerability Databases

```
Server -> Vulnerability Databases
```

1. Server compares software versions with vulnerability databases.
2. Server identifies vulnerable software and affected devices.

### 3 - Server Stores Vulnerability Information

```
Server -> DB
```

1. Server stores vulnerability information in the database.

### 4 - UI Displays Vulnerability Information

```
UI -> Server -> DB
```

1. UI requests vulnerability information from the server.
2. Server retrieves information from the database.
3. Server returns information to the UI.
4. UI displays the information.

## Vulnerability Data Sources

Fleet uses the following data sources for vulnerability information:

- **National Vulnerability Database (NVD)**: The U.S. government repository of standards-based vulnerability management data.
- **CVE Details**: A database of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE).
- **Vendor Security Advisories**: Security advisories published by software vendors.

## Vulnerability Scoring

Fleet uses the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) to assess the severity of vulnerabilities. CVSS provides a way to capture the principal characteristics of a vulnerability and produce a numerical score reflecting its severity.

## Vulnerability Remediation

Fleet provides the following mechanisms for vulnerability remediation:

- **Software Updates**: Updating vulnerable software to patched versions.
- **Software Removal**: Removing vulnerable software from devices.
- **Configuration Changes**: Changing configurations to mitigate vulnerabilities.

## Integration with External Systems

The Vulnerability Management architecture integrates with the following external systems:

- **Ticketing Systems**: Integration with ticketing systems for vulnerability remediation workflows.
- **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)**: Integration with SIEM systems for security monitoring.
- **Compliance Systems**: Integration with compliance systems for vulnerability reporting.
