# Vulnerability management architecture

This document provides an overview of Fleet's vulnerability management architecture.

## Introduction

Vulnerability management in Fleet identifies and manages software vulnerabilities in the device fleet. This document provides insights into the design decisions, system components, and interactions specific to the Vulnerability management functionality.

## Architecture overview

The Vulnerability management architecture enables the identification, tracking, and remediation of software vulnerabilities across a fleet of devices. It compares installed software versions with known vulnerabilities and provides information about affected devices.
