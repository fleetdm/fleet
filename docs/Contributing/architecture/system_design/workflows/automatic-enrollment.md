# Automatic Enrollment

## MacOS

### MacOS enrolled in ABM and assigned to MDM server

This example will follow a macOS host with serial AAAA assigned to the MDM server in ABM that matches the fleet
server with the corresponding ABM token uploaded.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
        participant H as Host A
        participant O as Fleet Osquery
        participant S as Fleet Server
        participant N as Fleet Nano
        participant W as Fleet Webview
        participant A as Apple

        S->>S: Cron every 1hr to pull list of host serials from ABM
        S->>A: Define a profile
        A-->>S: Get UUID
        S->>A: Assign Serial number to UUID (bulk list sometimes)
        A-->>S: Responses w/ succes / Not available / error (list of responses)

        H->>A: Boot and get Enrollment Json<br/>Get configuration_web_url (for SSO)

        H->>S: Enroll via DEP
        S->>A: Send MDM commands to enqueue Profiles
        A-->>H: Send profiles
        S->>S: Check profile status till complete
        O->>S: Start Setup Experience...
        O->>H: Launch Swift Dialog
        O->>S: Request SE items status
        O->>O: Update Swift dialog statuses till complete
        O-->>H: Close swift dialog
        S->>A: Release device
        A-->>H: User allowed to continue to user creation

```

In the diagram above the step 'define a profile' sends json like this to apple

```
{
  "org_magic": "1",
  "url": "https://<mdmserver>/mdm/sso",
  "configuration_web_url": "https://<mdmserver>/mdm/sso",
  "is_supervised": false,
  "allow_pairing": true,
  "is_mandatory": false,
  "is_mdm_removable": true,

  "do_not_use_profile_from_backup": false,

  "skip_setup_items": [
    "Accessibility",
    "Appearance",
    "AppleID",

  ],
  "language": "en",
  "region": "US",
  "profile_uuid": "C3B588...",
  "profile_name": "Fleet default enrollment profile"
}
```

Following the profile assignment to Serials you can use [this tool](TODO) to check the status with
ABM

```
{
  "serial_number": "H9V...",
  "model": "MacBook Pro (16-inch, Nov 2023)",
  "description": "MBP 16 SB/12C/18C GPU/36G/512G-USA",
  "color": "SPACE BLACK",
  "profile_status": "pushed",
  "profile_uuid": "C3B588...",
  "profile_assign_time": "2025-04-10T22:18:15Z",
  "profile_push_time": "2025-04-10T22:28:27Z",
  "device_assigned_date": "2024-08-14T19:29:59Z",
  "device_assigned_by": "abm_user@example.com",
  "os": "OSX",
  "device_family": "Mac",
  "op_date": "0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"
}
```

## Windows (planned)
Automatic enrollment via Windows Autopilot + Intune MDM integration. Expected high-level:
1. Device registered in Autopilot (hardware hash)
2. Intune assigned deployment profile including Fleet MSI install + config policy
3. During OOBE, device enrolls in Intune; receives MSI install
4. Orbit enrolls to Fleet; MDM channel (when supported) associates device IDs
5. Profiles / scripts delivered via Fleet Windows MDM endpoints.

Status tracking analogous to macOS: device record transitions from pending -> enrolled -> profiles applied.

## Key considerations
* Timing: macOS DEP flow occurs before user creation when `await_device_configured=true` delaying user access until baseline profiles & setup assistant complete.
* Scalability: ABM serial sync batched (bulk list) â€“ handle partial failures; exponential backoff on Apple API rate limits.
* Security: ABM tokens rotated; restrict access logs.
* Observability: activities log entries for each major step (assignment, enroll, profile install) enabling audit.
