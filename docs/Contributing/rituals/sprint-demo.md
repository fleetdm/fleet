### Presentation Guidelines
- **Time limit**: 3-10 minutes per contribution.
- **Format**: Live demonstration preferred over slides.
- **Audience**: Mixed technical and non-technical stakeholders.
- **Focus**: User impact and capabilities, not implementation details.
- **Privacy**: No specific customer names or confidential information.

Keep presentations accessible to all participants. Avoid overly technical details. Focus on demonstrating what users can now do rather than how it was built.

For **features**: Show what is now capable and demonstrate the user experience.

For **bug fixes**: Explain how the issue impacted existing customers.

**Important**: These meetings are recorded and posted publicly. Do not mention specific customer names.
