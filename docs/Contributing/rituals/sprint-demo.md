### Agenda
- Introduction and overview of sprint accomplishments
- Feature demonstrations (show capabilities and user impact)
- Bug fix presentations (explain customer impact and resolution)
- Q&A and discussion time
- Closing and next release timeline

### Notes
Keep presentations accessible to all participants - avoid overly technical details. Focus on demonstrating what users can now do rather than how it was built.

For **features**: Show what is now capable and demonstrate the user experience.

For **bug fixes**: Explain how the issue might have impacted existing customers and demonstrate how the resolution addresses the problem.

**Important**: These meetings are recorded and posted publicly. Do not mention specific customer names. Instead, use general terms like "a publicly-traded hosting company" or refer to customer types by their business model.

### Presentation Guidelines
- **Time limit**: 3-10 minutes per contribution
- **Format**: Live demonstration preferred over slides
- **Audience**: Mixed technical and non-technical stakeholders  
- **Focus**: User impact and capabilities, not implementation details
- **Privacy**: No specific customer names or confidential information
