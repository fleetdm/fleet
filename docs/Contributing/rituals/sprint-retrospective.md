## [Sprint Retrospective](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/product-groups#sprint-ceremonies) 

Purpose: Encourage discussions among the team and stakeholders to reflect on the sprint and identify improvements for future sprints.

Cadence: On the last day of each sprint, typically after the sprint demo, 30-45 minutes.

Participants: Full product group and stakeholders.

### Format
1. The EM or designated facilitator opens the retrospective and sets a collaborative tone.
2. The facilitator shares their screen with a shared document or retrospective tool.
3. Team members contribute thoughts in each of the three key areas.
4. The facilitator encourages open discussion and ensures all voices are heard.
5. Team identifies specific action items for improvement.
6. The facilitator assigns owners and due dates for action items.
7. The facilitator documents outcomes and closes the session.

### Agenda
- **What went well** - Celebrate successes, effective practices, and positive outcomes from the sprint
- **What could have been better** - Identify challenges, bottlenecks, and areas for improvement
- **What we learned** - Capture insights, new knowledge, and lessons from the sprint experience
- **Action items** - Define specific, actionable improvements with owners and timelines

### Notes
Create a safe environment for honest feedback. Focus on process and collaboration improvements rather than individual performance. 

Retrospectives should result in concrete action items that can be implemented in future sprints. The EM or facilitator should track action items and follow up on progress.

Consider using techniques like:
- Anonymous input collection for sensitive topics
- Timeboxing each section to maintain focus
- Dot voting to prioritize improvement areas
- Regular follow-up on previous action items

### Best Practices
- **Be specific**: Vague feedback like "communication could be better" should be explored with concrete examples
- **Focus forward**: While discussing problems, emphasize solutions and improvements
- **Action-oriented**: Every major issue identified should result in an actionable next step
- **Psychological safety**: Ensure team members feel comfortable sharing honest feedback
- **Follow through**: Track and report on action items from previous retrospectives
