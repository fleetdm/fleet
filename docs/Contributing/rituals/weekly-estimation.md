## [Weekly Estimation](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/product-groups#sprint-ceremonies) 

Purpose: Review user stories and bugs that have completed the drafting and specification process and add point estimates.

Cadence: Weekly, 1 hour or more as needed.

Participants: Full product group.

Facilitator: EM or assigned team member.

> All participants are expected to review every user story for their product group in the "Ready to estimate" column before Weekly Estimation. It is the facilitator's responsibility to make sure the team is notified and has adequate time to review each issue before the ritual.

### Format
1. The facilitator shares their screen and navigates to the [Drafting board](https://github.com/orgs/fleetdm/projects/67) filtered by their product group label.
2. The facilitator filters by the `story` label. 
3. For each user story or bug, the facilitator completes the user story estimation process below.
2. The facilitator filters by the `bug` label. 
3. For each bug, the facilitator completes the bug estimation process below.

### User story estimation
- Read the user story title and description aloud. 
- Open any Figma designs and review together. 
- Read all sub-task titles aloud. 
- Ask the team if there are any questions or concerns. 
- If no, go through each sub-task and complete estimation (sync or async).
- If yes, discuss questions or concerns and atempt to resolve on the call to complete estimation. If more time is needed, the user story is pushed to the next Weekly Estimation, or an ad-hoc estimation session if needed.

### Bug estimation
- Read the user story title and description aloud.
- Read the reproduction steps aloud. 
- Ask the team if there are any questions or concerns.
- If no, estimate the bug (sync or async). 
- If yes, discuss questions or concerns and atempt to resolve on the call to complete estimation. If more time is needed, the bug is pushed to the next Weekly Estimation, or an ad-hoc estimation session if needed.

### Notes
The EM is responsible for final point values and ensuring estimates are realistic. These sessions focus on understanding scope, effort, and complexity. Estimation sessions help align the roadmap with business needs by providing realistic timelines for work completion.
