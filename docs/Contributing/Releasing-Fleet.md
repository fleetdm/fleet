# Releasing Fleet

Note: Please prefix versions with `fleet-v` (eg. `fleet-v4.0.0`) in git tags, Helm charts, and NPM configs.

1. Update the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) with the changes that have been made since the last
   Fleet release. Use `make changelog` to pull the changes files into `CHANGELOG.md`, then manually
   edit. When editing, order the most relevant/important changes at the time, and try to make the
   tone and syntax of the written language match throughout. `make changelog` will stage all changes
   file entries for deletion with the commit.

   Add a "Performance" section below the list of changes. This section should summarize the number of
   hosts that the Fleet server can handle, call out if this number has
   changed since the last release, and list the infrastructure used in the load testing environment.

   Update version numbers in the relevant files:

   - [package.json](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/blob/main/tools/fleetctl-npm/package.json) (do not yet `npm publish`)
   - [Helm chart](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/blob/main/charts/fleet/Chart.yaml) and [values file](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/blob/main/charts/fleet/values.yaml)
   - [Terraform variables](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/blob/main/tools/terraform/variables.tf)

   Commit these changes via Pull Request and pull the changes on the `main` branch locally. Check that
   `HEAD` of the `main` branch points to the commit with these changes.

2. Tag and push the new release in Git:

   ```sh
   git tag fleet-v<VERSION>
   git push origin fleet-v<VERSION>
   ```

   Note that `origin` may be `upstream` depending on your `git remote` configuration. The intent here
   is to push the new tag to the `github.com/fleetdm/fleet` repository.

   GitHub Actions will automatically begin building the new release after the tag is pushed.

   Wait while GitHub Actions creates and uploads the artifacts...

   When the Actions Workflow has completed:

3. Edit the draft release on the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/releases).
   Use the version number as the release title. Use the below template for the release description
   (replace items in <> with the appropriate values):

   ````
   ### Changes

   <COPY FROM CHANGELOG>

   ### Upgrading

   Please visit our [update guide](https://fleetdm.com/docs/using-fleet/updating-fleet) for upgrade instructions.

   ### Documentation

   Documentation for Fleet is available at [fleetdm.com/docs](https://fleetdm.com/docs).

   ### Binary Checksum

   **SHA256**
   ```
   <COPY FROM checksums.txt>
   ```
   ````

   When editing is complete, publish the release.

4. Publish the new version of `fleetctl` on NPM. Run `npm publish` in the
   [fleetctl-npm](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/tree/main/tools/fleetctl-npm) directory. Note that NPM does not allow replacing a
   package without creating a new version number. Take care to get things correct before running
   `npm publish`!

> If releasing a "prerelease" of Fleet, run `npm publish --tag prerelease`. This way, you can
> publish a prerelease of fleetctl while the most recent fleetctl npm package, available for public
> download, is still the latest _official_ release.

5. Announce the release in the #fleet channel of [osquery
   Slack](https://osquery.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-h29zm0gk-s2DBtGUTW4CFel0f0IjTEw#/) and
   update the channel's topic with the link to this release. Using `@here` requires admin
   permissions, so typically this announcement will be done by `@zwass`.

   Announce the release via blog post (on Medium) and Twitter (linking to blog post).

## Patch releases

Generally, a patch should be released when bugs or performance issues are identified that prevent
users from getting their job done with Fleet.

### Process

#### The easy way

If all commits on `main` are acceptable for a patch (no high-risk changes, new features, etc.), then
the process is easy. Just follow the regular release process as described above, incrementing
only the patch (`major.minor.patch`) of the version number. In this scenario, there is no need to
perform any of the steps below.

#### The hard way

When only some of the newer changes in `main` are acceptable for release, a separate patch branch
must be created and relevant changes cherry-picked onto that branch:

1. Create the new branch, starting from the git tag of the prior release. Patch branches should be
   prefixed with `patch-`. In this example we are creating `4.3.1`:

   ```
   git checkout fleet-v4.3.0
   git checkout --branch patch-fleet-v4.3.1
   ```

2. Cherry pick the necessary commits into the new branch:

   ```
   git cherry-pick d34db33f
   ```

3. Push the branch to github.com/fleetdm/fleet:

   ```
   git push origin patch-fleet-v4.3.1
   ```

   When a `patch-*` branch is pushed, the [Docker publish
   Action](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/actions/workflows/goreleaser-snapshot-fleet.yaml) will
   be invoked to push a container image for QA with `fleetctl preview` (eg. `fleetctl preview --tag patch-fleet-v4.3.1`).

4. Check in the GitHub UI that Actions ran successfully for this branch and perform [QA smoke
   testing](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/smoke-tests.md).

5. Follow the standard release instructions at the top of this document. Be sure that modifications
   to the changelog and config files are commited _on the `patch-*` branch_. When the patch has been
   released, return to finish the following steps.

6. Cherry-pick the commit containing the changelog updates into a new branch, and merge that commit
   into `main` through a Pull Request.

7. **Important!** Manually check the database migrations. Any migrations that are not cherry-picked in a
   patch must have a _higher_ timestamp than migrations that were cherry-picked. If there
   are new migrations that were not cherry-picked, verify that those migrations have higher
   timestamps. If they do not, submit a new Pull Request to increase the timestamps and ensure that
   migrations are run in the appropriate order.
