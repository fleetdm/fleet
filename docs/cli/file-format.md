# Configuration File Format

A Fleet configuration is defined using one or more declarative "messages" in yaml syntax. Each message can live in it's own file or multiple in one file, each separated by `---`. Each file/message contains a few required top-level keys:

- `apiVersion` - the API version of the file/request
- `spec` - the "data" of the request
- `kind ` - the type of file/object (i.e.: pack, query, config)

The file may optionally also include some `metadata` for more complex data types (i.e.: packs).

When you reason about how to manage these config files, consider following the [General Config Tips](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/overview/#general-config-tips) published by the Kubernetes project. Some of the especially relevant tips are included here as well:

- When defining configurations, specify the latest stable API version.
- Configuration files should be stored in version control before being pushed to the cluster. This allows quick roll-back of a configuration if needed. It also aids with cluster re-creation and restoration if necessary.
- Group related objects into a single file whenever it makes sense. One file is often easier to manage than several. See the [config-single-file.yml](../../examples/config-single-file.yml) file as an example of this syntax.
- Don’t specify default values unnecessarily – simple and minimal configs will reduce errors.

All of these files can be concatenated together into [one file](../../examples/config-single-file.yml) (seperated by `---`), or they can be in [individual files with a directory structure](../../examples/config-many-files) like the following:

```
|-- config.yml
|-- labels.yml
|-- packs
|   `-- osquery-monitoring.yml
`-- queries.yml
```

## Convert Osquery JSON

`fleetctl` includes easy tooling to convert osquery pack JSON into the
`fleetctl` format. Use `fleetctl convert` with a path to the pack file:

```
fleetctl convert -f test.json
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: pack
spec:
  name: test
  queries:
  - description: "this is a test query"
    interval: 10
    name: processes
    query: processes
    removed: false
  targets:
    labels: null
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: query
spec:
  name: processes
  query: select * from processes
```

## Osquery Queries

For especially long or complex queries, you may want to define one query in one file. Continued edits and applications to this file will update the query as long as the `metadata.name` does not change. If you want to change the name of a query, you must first create a new query with the new name and then delete the query with the old name. Make sure the old query name is not defined in any packs before deleting it or an error will occur.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: query
spec:
  name: docker_processes
  description: The docker containers processes that are running on a system.
  query: select * from docker_container_processes;
  support:
    osquery: 2.9.0
    platforms:
      - linux
      - darwin
```

To define multiple queries in a file, concatenate multiple `query` resources together in a single file with `---`. For example, consider a file that you might store at `queries/osquery_monitoring.yml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: query
spec:
  name: osquery_version
  description: The version of the Launcher and Osquery process
  query: select launcher.version, osquery.version from kolide_launcher_info launcher, osquery_info osquery;
  support:
    launcher: 0.3.0
    osquery: 2.9.0
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: query
spec:
  name: osquery_schedule
  description: Report performance stats for each file in the query schedule.
  query: select name, interval, executions, output_size, wall_time, (user_time/executions) as avg_user_time, (system_time/executions) as avg_system_time, average_memory, last_executed from osquery_schedule;
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: query
spec:
  name: osquery_info
  description: A heartbeat counter that reports general performance (CPU, memory) and version.
  query: select i.*, p.resident_size, p.user_time, p.system_time, time.minutes as counter from osquery_info i, processes p, time where p.pid = i.pid;
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: query
spec:
  name: osquery_events
  description: Report event publisher health and track event counters.
  query: select name, publisher, type, subscriptions, events, active from osquery_events;
```

## Query Packs

To define query packs, reference queries defined elsewhere by name. This is why the "name" of a query is so important. You can define many of these packs in many files.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: pack
spec:
  name: osquery_monitoring
  disabled: false
  targets:
    labels:
      - All Hosts
  queries:
    - query: osquery_version
      name: osquery_version_differential
      interval: 7200
    - query: osquery_version
      name: osquery_version_snapshot
      interval: 7200
      snapshot: true
    - query: osquery_schedule
      interval: 7200
      removed: false
    - query: osquery_events
      interval: 86400
      removed: false
    - query: osquery_info
      interval: 600
      removed: false
```

## Host Labels

The following file describes the labels which hosts should be automatically grouped into. The label resource should include the actual SQL query so that the label is self-contained:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: label
spec:
  name: slack_not_running
  query: >
    SELECT * from system_info
    WHERE NOT EXISTS (
      SELECT *
      FROM processes
      WHERE name LIKE "%Slack%"
    );
```

Labels can also be "manually managed". When defining the label, reference hosts
by hostname:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: label
spec:
  name: Manually Managed Example
  label_membership_type: manual
  hosts:
    - hostname1
    - hostname2
    - hostname3
```


## Osquery Configuration Options

The following file describes options returned to osqueryd when it checks for configuration. See the [osquery documentation](https://osquery.readthedocs.io/en/stable/deployment/configuration/#options) for the available options. Existing options will be over-written by the application of this file.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: options
spec:
  config:
    options:
      distributed_interval: 3
      distributed_tls_max_attempts: 3
      logger_plugin: tls
      logger_tls_endpoint: /api/v1/osquery/log
      logger_tls_period: 10
    decorators:
      load:
        - "SELECT version FROM osquery_info"
        - "SELECT uuid AS host_uuid FROM system_info"
      always:
        - "SELECT user AS username FROM logged_in_users WHERE user <> '' ORDER BY time LIMIT 1"
      interval:
        3600: "SELECT total_seconds AS uptime FROM uptime"
  overrides:
    # Note configs in overrides take precedence over the default config defined
    # under the config key above. Hosts receive overrides based on the platform
    # returned by `SELECT platform FROM os_version`. In this example, the base
    # config would be used for Windows and CentOS hosts, while Mac and Ubuntu
    # hosts would receive their respective overrides. Note, these overrides are
    # NOT merged with the top level configuration.
    platforms:
      darwin:
        options:
          distributed_interval: 10
          distributed_tls_max_attempts: 10
          logger_plugin: tls
          logger_tls_endpoint: /api/v1/osquery/log
          logger_tls_period: 300
          disable_tables: chrome_extensions
          docker_socket: /var/run/docker.sock
        file_paths:
          users:
            - /Users/%/Library/%%
            - /Users/%/Documents/%%
          etc:
            - /etc/%%

      ubuntu:
        options:
          distributed_interval: 10
          distributed_tls_max_attempts: 3
          logger_plugin: tls
          logger_tls_endpoint: /api/v1/osquery/log
          logger_tls_period: 60
          schedule_timeout: 60
          docker_socket: /etc/run/docker.sock
        file_paths:
          homes:
            - /root/.ssh/%%
            - /home/%/.ssh/%%
          etc:
            - /etc/%%
          tmp:
            - /tmp/%%
        exclude_paths:
          homes:
            - /home/not_to_monitor/.ssh/%%
          tmp:
            - /tmp/too_many_events/
        decorators:
          load:
            - "SELECT * FROM cpuid"
            - "SELECT * FROM docker_info"
          interval:
            3600: "SELECT total_seconds AS uptime FROM uptime"
```

### Auto Table Construction

You can use Fleet to query local SQLite databases as tables. For more information on creating ATC configuration from a SQLite database, see the [Osquery Automatic Table Construction documentation](https://osquery.readthedocs.io/en/stable/deployment/configuration/#automatic-table-construction)

If you already know what your ATC configuration needs to look like, you can add it to an options config file:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: options
spec:
  overrides:
    platforms:
      darwin:
        auto_table_construction:
          tcc_system_entries:
            query: "select service, client, allowed, prompt_count, last_modified from access"
            path: "/Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db"
            columns:
              - "service"
              - "client"
              - "allowed"
              - "prompt_count"
              - "last_modified"
```

## Fleet Configuration Options
The following file describes configuration options applied to the Fleet server.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: config
spec:
  host_expiry_settings:
    host_expiry_enabled: true
    host_expiry_window: 10
  host_settings:
    # "additional" information to collect from hosts along with the host
    # details. This information will be updated at the same time as other host
    # details and is returned by the API when host objects are returned. Users
    # must take care to keep the data returned by these queries small in
    # order to mitigate potential performance impacts on the Fleet server.
    additional_queries:
      time: select * from time
      macs: select mac from interface_details
  org_info:
    org_logo_url: "https://example.org/logo.png"
    org_name: Example Org
  server_settings:
    kolide_server_url: https://fleet.example.org:8080
  smtp_settings:
    authentication_method: authmethod_plain
    authentication_type: authtype_username_password
    domain: example.org
    enable_smtp: true
    enable_ssl_tls: true
    enable_start_tls: true
    password: supersekretsmtppass
    port: 587
    sender_address: fleet@example.org
    server: mail.example.org
    user_name: test_user
    verify_ssl_certs: true
  sso_settings:
    enable_sso: false
    entity_id: 1234567890
    idp_image_url: https://idp.example.org/logo.png
    idp_name: IDP Vendor 1
    issuer_uri: https://idp.example.org/SAML2/SSO/POST
    metadata: "<md:EntityDescriptor entityID="https://idp.example.org/SAML2"> ... /md:EntityDescriptor>"
    metadata_url: https://idp.example.org/idp-meta.xml
```
### SMTP Authentication

**Warning:** Be careful not to store your SMTP credentials in source control. It is recommended to set the password through the web UI or `fleetctl` and then remove the line from the checked in version. Fleet will leave the password as-is if the field is missing from the applied configuration.

The following options are available when configuring SMTP authentication:

- `smtp_settings.authentication_type`
  - `authtype_none` - use this if your SMTP server is open
  - `authtype_username_password` - use this if your SMTP server requires authentication with a username and password
- `smtp_settings.authentication_method` - required with authentication type `authtype_username_password`
  - `authmethod_cram_md5`
  - `authmethod_login`
  - `authmethod_plain`

## Enroll Secrets

The following file shows how to configure enroll secrets. Note that secrets can be changed or made inactive, but not deleted. Hosts may not enroll with inactive secrets.

The name of the enroll secret used to authenticate is stored with the host and is included with API results.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: enroll_secret
spec:
  secrets:
  - active: true
    name: default
    secret: RzTlxPvugG4o4O5IKS/HqEDJUmI1hwBoffff
  - active: true
    name: new_one
    secret: reallyworks
  - active: false
    name: inactive_secret
    secret: thissecretwontwork!
```
