Statistics contain no personal information about any particular device or person.

For Fleet Free instances, usage statistics are anonymous. The "organization" property is reported as "unknown."

Sending Usage statistics from your Fleet Free instance is optional and can be disabled.

Note: Usage statistics are not optional for Fleet Premium instances.

## Why should we enable usage statistics?

Help make Fleet better! Fleet has wide adoption, but limited avenues for quantifying this. We need a way of measuring whether the enhancements and new features we ship are actually working.

Every time we ship a Fleet release without usage statistics, it's like launching a shiny, expensive new rocket into space without any way to find out what happens to it. Up until now, we've relied heavily on talking to users and working closely with customers and other community members. That's helped a lot! But it doesn't give us visibility into the problems other users might be having.

Insights about Fleet version adoption helps the team be more efficient when planning upgrade guides, release notes, and future security notices for users running vulnerable software versions.

## Disable usage statistics

Users with the Admin role can disable usage statistics.

To disable usage statistics:

1. In the top navigation, navigate to **Settings > Organization settings**.

2. Scroll to the "Usage statistics" section.

3. Uncheck the "Enable usage statistics" checkbox and then select "Update settings."

Usage statistics can also be disabled via [configuration files](https://fleetdm.com/docs/configuration/configuration-files#server-settings-enable-analytics).
