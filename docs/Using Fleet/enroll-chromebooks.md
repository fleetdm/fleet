# ChromeOS
For visibility on ChromeOS hosts, Fleet provides the fleetd Chrome extension which provides similar functionality as osquery on other operating systems.

## Adding ChromeOS hosts to Fleet

To learn how to add ChromeOS hosts to Fleet, visit [here](https://fleetdm.com/docs/using-fleet/adding-hosts#add-chromebooks-with-the-fleetd-chrome-extension).

> The fleetd Chrome browser extension is supported on ChromeOS operating systems that are managed using [Google Admin](https://admin.google.com). It is not intended for non-ChromeOS hosts with the Chrome browser installed.

## Available tables
To see the available tables for ChromeOS, visit [here](https://fleetdm.com/tables/chrome_extensions?platformFilter=chrome).

## Setting the hostname
By default, the hostname for a Chromebook host will be blank. The hostname can be customized in Google Admin under Devices > Chrome > Settings > Device > Device Settings > Other Settings > [Device network hostname template](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/1375678#zippy=%2Cdevice-network-hostname-template%2Creport-device-os-information).

## Current limitations in ChromeOS
- Scheduled queries are currently not available in ChromeOS
- The Fleetd Chrome extension must be force-installed by enterprise policy in order to have full access to the host's data.
- More tables that could be added:
  - `disk_events`: https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/issues/12405
  - `client_certificates`: https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/issues/12465
  - `usb_devices`: https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/issues/12780
