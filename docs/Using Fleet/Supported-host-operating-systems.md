# Supported host operating systems

Fleet supports the following operating system versions on hosts. 

| OS      | Supported version(s)                    |
| :------ | :-------------------------------------  |
| macOS   | 13 (Ventura) and higher                |
| Windows | 10 (Pro and Enterprise) and higher      |
| Linux   | CentOS 7.1+,  Ubuntu 20.04+, Fedora 38+ |
| ChromeOS | 112.0.5615.134+                        |

While Fleet may still function partially or fully with OS versions older than those above, Fleet does not actively test against unsupported versions and does not pursue bugs on them. 

## Some notes on compatibility

### Tables
Not all osquery tables are available for every OS. Please check out the [osquery schema](https://fleetdm.com/tables) for detailed information. 

If a table is not available for your host, Fleet will generally handle things behind the scenes for you. 

### M1 Macs
Fleet's agent (fleetd) generated for MacOS by `fleetctl package` does not include native support for M1 Macs. Some values returned may reflect the information returned by Rosetta rather than the system. For example, a CPU will show up as `i486`. 

### Linux

> Ubuntu Linux:
> Fleet Desktop currently supports Xorg as X11 server, Wayland is currently not supported.
> Ubuntu 24.04 comes with Wayland enabled by default. To use X11 instead of Wayland you can set
> `WaylandEnable=false` in `/etc/gdm3/custom.conf` and reboot.

> Fedora, CentOS 8 and 9 require a [gnome extension](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/615/appindicator-support/) and Google Chrome set to the default browser for Fleet Desktop.

> The `fleetctl package` command is not supported on DISA-STIG distribution.
