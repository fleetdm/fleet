# Segment hosts

_Available in Fleet Premium_

In Fleet, you can group hosts together in a "team" in Fleet. This way, you can apply queries, policies, scripts, and more that are tailored to the hosts' risk/compliance needs.

A host can only belong to one team. 

You can give users access to only some teams.

You can manage teams by selecting your avatar in the top navigation and then **Settings > Teams**.

## Best practice

Fleet's best practice teams: 
- `💻 Workstations`: End users' production work computers (macOS, Windows, and Linux)
- `💻🐣 Workstations (canary)`: IT team's test work computers. Sometimes, for demos or testing, includes end user's work computers. Used for [dogfooding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food) a new workflow or feature that may or may not be rolled out to the "Workstations" team.
- `☁️ Servers`: Security team's production servers.
- `☁️🐣 Servers (canary)`: Security team's test servers.
- `Compliance exclusions`: All contributors' test work computers or virtual machines (VMs). Used for validating workflows for Fleet customers or reproducing bugs in the Fleet product.
- `📱🏢 Company-owned iPhones`: iPhones purchased by the organization that enroll to Fleet automatically via Apple Business Manager. For example, iPhones used by iOS Engineers.
- `🔳🏢 Company-owned iPads`: iPads purchased by the organization that enroll to Fleet automatically via Apple Business Manager. For example, conference-room iPads.
<!--- - `📱👔 BYOD iPhones`: End users' personal iPhones that have access to company resources. For example, Slack and Gmail. contributors' test iOS hosts. (BYOD iPhone features are coming soon) -->

If some of your hosts don't fall under the above teams, what are these hosts for? The answer determines the the hosts' risk/compliance needs, and thus their security basline, and thus their "team" in Fleet. If the hosts' have a different compliance needs, and thus different security baseline, then it's time to create a new team in Fleet.

## Adding hosts to a team

You can add hosts to a new team in Fleet by either enrolling the host with a team's enroll secret or by transferring the host via the Fleet UI after the host has been enrolled to Fleet.

## Advanced

You can automatically enroll hosts to a specific team in Fleet by installing a fleetd with a team enroll secret. Learn more [here](./enroll-hosts.md#enroll-host-to-a-specific-team).

Changing the host's enroll secret after enrollment will not cause the host to be transferred to a different team.
