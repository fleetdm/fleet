# Supported browsers

Fleet supports the latest, stable releases of all major browsers and platforms.

We test each browser on Windows whenever possible, because our engineering team primarily uses macOS.

**Note:** This information also applies to [fleetdm.com](https://www.fleetdm.com).

### Desktop

- Chrome
- Firefox
- Edge
- Safari (macOS only)

### Mobile

- Mobile Safari on iOS
- Mobile Chrome on Android

### Note
> - Mobile web is not yet supported in the Fleet product.
> - The Fleet user interface [may not be fully supported](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/issues/969) in Google Chrome when the browser is running on ChromeOS
