## Create a query

Queries in Fleet allow you to ask a multitude of questions to help you manage, monitor, and identify threats on your devices. 

If you're unsure of what to ask, head to Fleet's [query library](https://fleetdm.com/queries). There you'll find common queries that have been tested by members of our community.

How to create a query:

1. In the top navigation, select **Queries**.

2. Select **Create new query** to navigate to the query console.

3. In the **Query** field, enter your query. Remember, you can find common queries in [Fleet's library](https://fleetdm.com/queries).

4. Select **Save**, enter a name and description for your query, select the frequency that the query should run at, and select **Save query**.

## Run a query

Run a live query to get answers for all of your online hosts.

> Offline hosts won’t respond to a live query because they may be shut down, asleep, or not connected to the internet.

How to run a query:

1. In the top navigation, select **Queries**.

2. In the **Queries** table, find the query you'd like to run and select the query's name to navigate to the query console.

3. Select **Run query** to navigate to the target picker. Select **All hosts** and select **Run**. This will run the query against all your hosts.

The query may take several seconds to complete because Fleet has to wait for the hosts to respond with results.

> Fleet's query response time is inherently variable because of osquery's heartbeat response time. This helps prevent performance issues on hosts.

## Schedule a query

*In Fleet 4.35.0, the "Schedule" page was removed, and query automations are now configured on the "Queries" page. Instructions for scheduling queries in earlier versions of Fleet can be found [here](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/blob/ac797c8f81ede770853c25fd04102da9f5e109bf/docs/Using-Fleet/Fleet-UI.md#schedule-a-query).*

>Only users with the [admin role](https://fleetdm.com/docs/using-fleet/manage-access#admin) can manage query automations.

Fleet allows you to schedule queries to run at a set frequency. Scheduled queries will send data to your log destination automatically. 

The default log destination, **filesystem**, is good to start. With this set, data is sent to the `/var/log/osquery/osqueryd.snapshots.log` file on each host’s filesystem. To see which log destinations are available in Fleet, head to the [log destinations page](https://fleetdm.com/docs/using-fleet/log-destinations).

By default, queries that run on a schedule will only target platforms compatible with that query. This behavior can be overridden by setting the platforms in "advanced options" when saving a query.

**How to schedule queries:**

1. In the top navigation, select **Queries**.

2. Select **Manage automations**.

3. Check the box next to the queries you want to automate, and select **Save**.

> The frequency that queries run at is set when a query is created.

With Fleet Premium, you can schedule queries for groups of hosts using [the teams feature](https://fleetdm.com/docs/using-fleet/segment-hosts). This allows you to collect different data for each group.

> In Fleet Premium, groups of hosts are called "teams."

**How to use teams to schedule queries for a group of hosts:**

1. If you haven't already, first [create a team](https://fleetdm.com/docs/using-fleet/segment-hosts#create-a-team) and [transfer hosts](https://fleetdm.com/docs/using-fleet/segment-hosts#transfer-hosts-to-a-team) to the team.

2. In the top navigation, select **Queries**.

3. In the **Teams** dropdown below the top navigation, select the team you want to manage automation for.

4. Select **Manage automations**

5. Select the queries you want to run on a schedule for this team, and select **Save**.

   > Note: Only queries that belong to the selected team will be listed. When configuring query automations for all hosts, only global queries will be listed.

## Update agent options
