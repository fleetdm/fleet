# Deploy Fleet on Cloud.gov (Cloud Foundry)

Cloud.gov is a [FEDRAMP moderate Platform-as-a-Service
(PaaS)](https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/#!/product/18f-cloudgov?sort=productName). This repository
includes a sample [manifest.yml.example](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/blob/main/manifest.yml.cloudgov.example) file ready to be pushed and run the
latest version of fleetdm as a container. Make a copy of the example file and update the key
values as appropriate.

1. `cp manifest.yml.cloudgov.example manifest.yml`

2. Setup a cloud.gov account - https://cloud.gov/docs/getting-started/accounts/ 

3. Install the cf-cli - https://cloud.gov/docs/getting-started/setup/

4. From your local fleetdm source directory.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet
cd fleet
cf login -a api.fr.cloud.gov  --sso

# Follow the link to copy the Temporary Authentication Code when prompted
```

5. Setup a demo application space

```sh
cf target -o sandbox-gsa create-space fleetdm-rename
```

6. Create database(s)

```sh
# Update manifest.yml file to rename application and database key names to match commands below.

cf marketplace
cf create-service aws-rds medium-mysql fleetdm-mysql
cf create-service aws-elasticache-redis redis-dev fleetdm-redis
cf create-service-key fleetdm-db-rename fleetdm-db-test-key
cf push
```

**You will be returned the URL for your new test instance to navigate to.**

> Note: This is only for demonstration purposes, in order to run a production level federal/FISMA system. You will need to contact the [cloud.gov program](https://cloud.gov) and consult your organization's security team (for risk assessment and an Authority to Operate).


## Using jq to map service credentials

Cloud foundry injects an environmental variable [`$VCAP_SERVICES`](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/environment-variable.html#VCAP-SERVICES) which is available within the
container. fleetdm uses jq to map service injected credentials to the [standard fleetdm environment
variables](https://fleetdm.com/docs/deploying/configuration#using-only-environment-variables).
