Releasing Fleet
===============

1. Update the [CHANGELOG](/CHANGELOG.md) with the changes that have been made since the last Fleet release.

2. Tag and push the new release in Git:

``` shell
git tag <VERSION>
git push origin <VERSION>
```

3. Build the new binary bundle (ensure working tree is clean because this will effect the version string built into the binary):

``` shell
make binary-bundle
```

4. Create a new release on the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/releases). Select the newly pushed tag (GitHub should say "Existing tag"). Use the version number as the release title. Use the below template for the release description (replace items in <> with the appropriate values):
