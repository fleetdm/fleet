# Solutions Best Practices


## General

– Name the file what the profile does.
  - For example, instead of `googlePlayProtectVerifyApps.json` (the name of the
    Android policy for this control), describe what it does:
    `enforce-google-play-protect.json`.
– Use kebab case in file names, with all letters in lowercase.
  - Instead of `passwordPolicy.json`, use `password-policy.json`.
– Be sure to end files with an empty newline.
