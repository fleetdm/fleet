## How do I get support for working with Fleet?

For bug reports, please use the [Github issue tracker](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/issues).

For questions and discussion, please join us in the #fleet channel of [osquery Slack](https://fleetdm.com/slack).

## Can multiple instances of the Fleet server be run behind a load-balancer?

Yes. Fleet scales horizontally out of the box as long as all of the Fleet servers are connected to the same MySQL and Redis instances.

Note that osquery logs will be distributed across the Fleet servers.

Read the [performance documentation](../Using-Fleet/Monitoring-Fleet.md#fleet-server-performance) for more.

## Why aren't my osquery agents connecting to Fleet?

This can be caused by a variety of problems. The best way to debug is usually to add `--verbose --tls_dump` to the arguments provided to `osqueryd` and look at the logs for the server communication.

### Common problems

- `Connection refused`: The server is not running, or is not listening on the address specified. Is the server listening on an address that is available from the host running osquery? Do you have a load balancer that might be blocking connections? Try testing with `curl`.
- `No node key returned`: Typically this indicates that the osquery client sent an incorrect enroll secret that was rejected by the server. Check what osquery is sending by looking in the logs near this error.
- `certificate verify failed`: See [How do I fix "certificate verify failed" errors from osqueryd](#how-do-i-fix-certificate-verify-failed-errors-from-osqueryd).
- `bad record MAC`: When generating your certificate for your Fleet server, ensure you set the hostname to the FQDN or the IP of the server. This error is common when setting up Fleet servers and accepting defaults when generating certificates using `openssl`.

## How do I fix "certificate verify failed" errors from osqueryd?

Osquery requires that all communication between the agent and Fleet are over a secure TLS connection. For the safety of osquery deployments, there is no (convenient) way to circumvent this check.

- Try specifying the path to the full certificate chain used by the server using the `--tls_server_certs` flag in `osqueryd`. This is often unnecessary when using a certificate signed by an authority trusted by the system, but is mandatory when working with self-signed certificates. In all cases it can be a useful debugging step.
- Ensure that the CNAME or one of the Subject Alternate Names (SANs) on the certificate matches the address at which the server is being accessed. If osquery connects via `https://localhost:443`, but the certificate is for `https://fleet.example.com`, the verification will fail.
- Is Fleet behind a load-balancer? Ensure that if the load-balancer is terminating TLS, this is the certificate provided to osquery.
- Does the certificate verify with `curl`? Try `curl -v -X POST https://fleetserver:port/api/v1/osquery/enroll`.

## What do I need to do to change the Fleet server TLS certificate?

If the both the existing and new certificates verify with osquery's default root certificates (such as a certificate issued by a well-known Certificate Authority) and no certificate chain was deployed with osquery, there is no need to deploy a new certificate chain.

If osquery has been deployed with the full certificate chain (using `--tls_server_certs`), deploying a new certificate chain is necessary to allow for verification of the new certificate.

Deploying a certificate chain cannot be done centrally from Fleet.

## How do I use a proxy server with Fleet?

Seeing your proxy's requests fail with an error like `DEPTH_ZERO_SELF_SIGNED_CERT`)?
To get your proxy server's HTTP client to work with a local Fleet when using a self-signed cert, disable SSL / self-signed verification in the client.

The exact solution to this depends on the request client you are using. For example, when using Node.js Â± Sails.js, you can work around this in the requests you're sending with `await sails.helpers.http.get()` by lifting your app with the `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED` environment variable set to `0`:

```
NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0 sails console
```


## When do I need to deploy a new enroll secret to my hosts?

Osquery provides the enroll secret only during the enrollment process. Once a host is enrolled, the node key it receives remains valid for authentication independent from the enroll secret.

Currently enrolled hosts do not necessarily need enroll secrets updated, as the existing enrollment will continue to be valid as long as the host is not deleted from Fleet and the osquery store on the host remains valid. Any newly enrolling hosts must have the new secret.

Deploying a new enroll secret cannot be done centrally from Fleet.

## How do I migrate hosts from one Fleet server to another (eg. testing to production)?

Primarily, this would be done by changing the `--tls_hostname` and enroll secret to the values for the new server. In some circumstances (see [What do I need to do to change the Fleet server TLS certificate?](#what-do-i-need-to-do-to-change-the-fleet-server-tls-certificate)) it may be necessary to deploy a new certificate chain configured with `--tls_server_certs`.

These configurations cannot be managed centrally from Fleet.

## What do I do about "too many open files" errors?

This error usually indicates that the Fleet server has run out of file descriptors. Fix this by increasing the `ulimit` on the Fleet process. See the `LimitNOFILE` setting in the [example systemd unit file](./Configuration.md#runing-with-systemd) for an example of how to do this with systemd.

Some deployments may benefit by setting the [`--server_keepalive`](./Configuration.md#server-keepalive) flag to false.

This was also seen as a symptom of a different issue: if you're deploying on AWS on T type instances, there are different scenarios where the activity can increase and the instances will burst. If they run out of credits, then they'll stop processing leaving the file descriptors open.

## I upgraded my database, but Fleet is still running slowly. What could be going on?

This could be caused by a mismatched connection limit between the Fleet server and the MySQL server that prevents Fleet from fully utilizing the database. First [determine how many open connections your MySQL server supports](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/too-many-connections.html). Now set the [`--mysql_max_open_conns`](./Configuration.md#mysql-max-open-conns) and [`--mysql_max_idle_conns`](./Configuration.md#mysql-max-idle-conns) flags appropriately.

## Why am I receiving a database connection error when attempting to "prepare" the database?

First, check if you have a version of MySQL installed that is at least 5.7. Then, make sure that you currently have a MySQL server running.

The next step is to make sure the credentials for the database match what is expected. Test your ability to connect to the database with `mysql -u<username> -h<hostname_or_ip> -P<port> -D<database_name> -p`.

If you're successful connecting to the database and still receive a database connection error, you may need to specify your database credentials when running `fleet prepare db`. It's encouraged to put your database credentials in environment variables or a config file.

```
fleet prepare db \
    --mysql_address=<database_address> \
    --mysql_database=<database_name> \
    --mysql_username=<username> \
    --mysql_password=<database_password>
```

## Is Fleet available as a SaaS product?

No. Currently, Fleet is only available for self-hosting on premises or in the cloud.

## Is Fleet compatible with X flavor of MySQL?

Fleet is built to run on MySQL 5.7 or above. However, particularly with AWS Aurora, we recommend 2.10.0 and above, as we've seen issues with anything below that.

## What are the MySQL user requirements?

The user `fleet prepare db` (via environment variable `FLEET_MYSQL_USERNAME` or command line flag `--mysql_username=<username>`) uses to interact with the database needs to be able to create, alter, and drop tables as well as the ability to create temporary tables.

## Does Fleet support MySQL replication?

You can deploy MySQL or Maria any way you want. We recommend using managed/hosted mysql so you don't have to think about it, but you can think about it more if you want. Read replicas are supported. You can read more about MySQL configuration [here](./Configuration.md#my-sql).

## What is duplicate enrollment and how do I fix it?

Duplicate host enrollment is when more than one host enrolls in Fleet using the same identifier
(hardware UUID or osquery generated UUID).

Typically, this is caused by cloning a VM Image with an already enrolled
osquery client, which results in duplicate osquery generated UUIDs. To resolve this issue, it is
advised to configure `--osquery_host_identifier=uuid` (which will use the hardware UUID), and then
delete the associated host in the Fleet UI.

In rare instances, VM Hypervisors have been seen to duplicate hardware UUIDs. When this happens,
using `--osquery_host_identifier=uuid` will not resolve the duplicate enrollment problem. Sometimes
the problem can be resolved by setting `--osquery_host_identifier=instance` (which will use the
osquery generated UUID), and then delete the associated host in the Fleet UI.

Find more information about [host identifiers here](./Configuration.md#osquery-host-identifier).

## How long are osquery enroll secrets valid?

Enroll secrets are valid until you delete them.

## Should I use multiple enroll secrets?

That is up to you! Some organizations have internal goals around rotating secrets. Having multiple secrets allows some of them to work at the same time the rotation is happening.
Another reason you might want to use multiple enroll secrets is to use a certain enroll secret to
auto-enroll hosts into a specific team (Fleet Premium).

## How can enroll secrets be rotated?

Rotating enroll secrets follows this process:

1) Add a new secret.
2) Transition existing clients to the new secret. Note that existing clients may not need to be
   updated, as the enroll secret is not used by already enrolled clients.
3) Remove the old secret.

To do this with `fleetctl` (assuming the existing secret is `oldsecret` and the new secret is `newsecret`):

Begin by retrieving the existing secret configuration:

```
$ fleetctl get enroll_secret
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: enroll_secret
spec:
  secrets:
  - created_at: "2021-11-17T00:39:50Z"
    secret: oldsecret
```

Apply the new configuration with both secrets:

```
$ echo '
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: enroll_secret
spec:
  secrets:
  - created_at: "2021-11-17T00:39:50Z"
    secret: oldsecret
  - secret: newsecret
' > secrets.yml
$ fleetctl apply -f secrets.yml
```

Now transition clients to using only the new secret. When the transition is completed, remove the
old secret:

```
$ echo '
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: enroll_secret
spec:
  secrets:
  - secret: newsecret
' > secrets.yml
$ fleetctl apply -f secrets.yml
```

At this point, the old secret will no longer be accepted for new enrollments and the rotation is
complete.

A similar process may be followed for rotating team-specific enroll secrets. For teams, the secrets
are managed in the team yaml.

## How do I resolve an "unknown column" error when upgrading Fleet?

The `unknown column` error typically occurs when the database migrations haven't been run during the upgrade process.

Check out the [documentation on running database migrations](./Upgrading-Fleet.md#running-database-migrations) to resolve this issue.

## What API endpoints should I expose to the public internet?

If you would like to manage hosts that can travel outside your VPN or intranet we recommend only exposing the "/api/v1/osquery" endpoint to the public internet.

## What is the minimum version of MySQL required by Fleet?

Fleet requires at least MySQL version 5.7.

## How do I migrate from Fleet Free to Fleet Premium?
To migrate from Fleet Free to Fleet Premium, once you get a Fleet license, set it as a parameter to `fleet serve` either as an environment variable using `FLEET_LICENSE_KEY` or in the Fleet's config file. See [here](https://fleetdm.com/docs/deploying/configuration#license) for more details. Note: You don't need to redeploy Fleet after the migration.
