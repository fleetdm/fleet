# Migration

Only one MDM solution can be used for MDM features, like enforcing settings, on each of your macOS hosts. This section provides instructions for migrating away from your old MDM solution so that you can use Fleet for MDM features.

To migrate hosts from your old MDM solution to Fleet you’ll first have to [deploy Fleet](../Deploying/Introduction.md), [add your hosts](./Adding-hosts.md), and [connect Fleet to Apple](./MDM-setup.md).

## Manually enrolled hosts

If you have macOS hosts that were manually enrolled to your old MDM solution, you can migrate them to Fleet.

> Make sure your end users have an admin account on their Mac. End users won't be able to migrate on their own if they have a standard account.

How to migrate manually enrolled hosts:

1. In your old MDM solution, unenroll these hosts. MacOS does not allow multiple MDMs to be installed at once. This step is required to present end users with instructions to turn on MDM in Fleet.

2. The **My Device** page in Fleet Desktop will present end users with instructions to turn on MDM. Share [these guided instructions](#instructions-for-end-users) with your end users.

## Automatically enrolled (DEP) hosts

_Available in Fleet Premium_

If you have macOS hosts that were automatically enrolled to your old MDM solution, you can migrate them to Fleet.

> Make sure your end users have an admin account on their Mac. End users won't be able to migrate on their own if they have a standard account.

To check if you have hosts that were automatically enrolled, login to [Apple Business Manager](https://business.apple.com/) and select Devices.

How to migrate these hosts:

1. Connect Fleet to Apple Business Manager (ABM). Learn how [here](./MDM-setup.md#apple-business-manager-abm).

2. In ABM, unassign these hosts' MDM server from the old MDM solution: In ABM, select **Devices** and then select **All Devices**. Then, select **Edit** next to **Edit MDM Server**, select **Unassign from the current MDM**, and select **Continue**.

3. In ABM, assign these hosts' MDM server to Fleet: In ABM, select **Devices** and then select **All Devices**. Then, select **Edit** next to **Edit MDM Server**, select **Assign to the following MDM:**, select your Fleet server in the dropdown, and select **Continue**.

4. In your old MDM solution, unenroll these hosts. MacOS does not allow multiple MDMs to be installed at once. This step is required to present end users with instructions to turn on MDM in Fleet.

5. The **My Device** page in Fleet Desktop will present end users with instructions to turn on MDM. Share [these guided instructions](#instructions-for-end-users) with your end users.

## FileVault recovery keys

_Available in Fleet Premium_

In Fleet, you can enforce FileVault (disk encryption) to be on. If turned on, hosts’ disk encryption keys will be stored in Fleet. Learn how [here](./MDM-macOS-settings.md#disk-encryption).

During migration from your old MDM solution, disk encryption will be turned off for your macOS hosts until they are enrolled to Fleet and MDM is turned on for these hosts.

If your old MDM solution enforced disk encryption, your end users will need to reset their disk encryption key for Fleet to be able to store the key. The **My device** page in Fleet Desktop will present users with instructions to reset their key. Share [these guided instructions](#how-to-turn-on-disk-encryption) with your end users.

## Activation Lock Bypass codes

In Fleet, the [Activation Lock](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208987) feature is disabled by default for automatically enrolled (DEP) hosts.

If a Mac has Activation Lock enabled, we recommend asking the end user to follow these instructions to disable Activation Lock before migrating this host to Fleet: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208987.

This is because if the Activation Lock is enabled, you will need the Activation Lock bypass code to successfully wipe and reuse the Mac.

Activation Lock bypass codes can only be retrieved from the Mac up to 30 days after the device is enrolled. This means that when migrating from your old MDM solution, it’s likely that you’ll be unable to retrieve the Activation Lock bypass code.

## Migrate settings

To enforce the same settings on your macOS hosts in Fleet as you did using your old MDM solution, you have to migrate these settings to Fleet.

If your old MDM solution enforced FileVault, follow [these instructions](#how-to-turn-on-disk-encryption) to enforce FileVault (disk encryption) using Fleet.

For all other settings you enforced, you have to first export these settings as configuration profiles from your old MDM solution. Then, you have to add the configuration profiles to Fleet.

How to export settings as configuration profiles:

1. Check if your MDM solution has a feature that allows you to export settings as configuration profiles. If it does, make sure these configuration profiles are exported as .mobileconfig files. If it doesn't, follow the instructions to create configuration profiles using iMazing Profile Creator [here](./MDM-macOS-settings.md#create-a-configuration-profiles-with-imazing-profile-creator). Use iMazing Profile Creator to replicate the settings you enforced.

2. Follow the instructions to add configuration profiles to Fleet [here](./MDM-macOS-settings.md#add-configuration-profiles-to-fleet).

## Instructions for end users

Your organization uses Fleet to check if all devices meet its security policies.

Fleet includes device management features (called “MDM”) that allow your IT team to change settings remotely on your Mac. This lets your organization keep your Mac up to date so you don’t have to.
