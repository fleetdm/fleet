# Automations

You can configure automations in Fleet to send a webhook request or create a ticket (Jira or Zendesk) if a certain condition is met.

[Vulnerability automations](#vulnerability-automations) are triggered if a new vulnerability (CVE) is
detected on at least one host.

[Policy automations](#policy-automations) are triggered if a policy is newly failing on at
least one host.

[Host status automations](#host-status-automations) are triggered if a configured
percentage of hosts have not checked in to Fleet for a configured number of days.

## Vulnerability automations

Vulnerability automations are triggered if a new vulnerability (CVE) is
found on at least one host.

> Note that a CVE is "new" if it was published to the national vulnerability (NVD) database within
> the last 30 days (by default).

Fleet checks if it's time to send these webhook requests, or create tickets (Jira or Zendesk), once every hour. 

If two new vulnerabilities are detected
within the hour, two
webhook requests are sent. This interval can be updated with the [`vulnerabilities_periodicity` configuration option](../Deploying/Configuration.md#periodicity).

Example webhook payload:

```
POST https://server.com/example
```

```json
{
  "timestamp": "0000-00-00T00:00:00Z",
  "vulnerability": {
    "cve": "CVE-2014-9471",
    "details_link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2014-9471",
    "epss_probability": 0.7, // Premium feature only
    "cvss_score": 5.7, // Premium feature only
    "cisa_known_exploit": true, // Premium feature only
    "hosts_affected": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "hostname": "macbook-1",
        "url": "https://fleet.example.com/hosts/1"
      },
      {
        "id": 2,
        "hostname": "macbook-2",
        "url": "https://fleet.example.com/hosts/2"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

You can configure Fleet to create a ticket instead of a webhook request.

Follow the steps below to configure Jira or Zendesk as a ticket destination:

1. In the top bar of the Fleet UI, select your avatar and then **Settings**.
2. Select **Integrations > Add integration**.
3. Under **Ticket destination** select **Jira** or select **Zendesk**.
4. Enter your ticket destination's credentials.
5. In the top bar, select **Software > Manage automations**.
6. Select **Enable vulnerability automations** and choose **Ticket**.
7. Under **Ticket destination**, select your ticket destination and select **Save**.

The Jira and Zendesk ticket destinations are currently in beta.

## Policy automations

Policy automations are triggered if a policy is newly failing on at
least one host.

> Note that a policy is "newly failing" if a host updated its response from "no response" to "failing"
> or from "passing" to "failing."

Fleet checks if it's time to send these webhook requests, or create tickets (Jira or Zendesk), once every day. 

If two policies are newly failing
within the day, two webhook requests are sent. This interval can be updated with the `webhook_settings.interval`
configuration option using the [`config` yaml document](./configuration-files/README.md#organization-settings) and the `fleetctl apply` command.

Example webhook payload:

```
POST https://server.com/example
```

```json
{
  "timestamp": "0000-00-00T00:00:00Z",
  "policy": {
    "id": 1,
      "name": "Is Gatekeeper enabled?",
      "query": "SELECT 1 FROM gatekeeper WHERE assessments_enabled = 1;",
      "description": "Checks if gatekeeper is enabled on macOS devices.",
      "author_id": 1,
      "author_name": "John",
      "author_email": "john@example.com",
      "resolution": "Turn on Gatekeeper feature in System Preferences.",
      "passing_host_count": 2000,
      "failing_host_count": 300
  },
  "hosts": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "hostname": "macbook-1",
      "url": "https://fleet.example.com/hosts/1"
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "hostname": "macbbook-2",
      "url": "https://fleet.example.com/hosts/2"
    }
  ]
}
```

You can configure Fleet to create a ticket instead of a webhook request.

Follow the steps below to configure Jira or Zendesk as a ticket destination:

1. In the top bar of the Fleet UI, select your avatar and then **Settings**.
2. Select **Integrations > Add integration**.
3. Under **Ticket destination** select **Jira** or select **Zendesk**.
4. Enter your ticket destination's credentials.
5. In the top bar, select **Policies > Manage automations**.
6. Select **Enable policy automations**, check the policies you'd like to listen to, and choose **Ticket**.
7. Under **Ticket destination**, select your ticket destination and select **Save**.

The Jira and Zendesk ticket destinations are currently in beta.

## Host status automations

Host status automations send a webhook request if a configured
percentage of hosts have not checked in to Fleet for a configured number of days.

Fleet sends these webhook requests once per day. This interval can be updated with the `webhook_settings.interval`
configuration option using the [`config` yaml document](./configuration-files/README.md#organization-settings) and the `fleetctl apply` command.

Example webhook payload:

```
POST https://server.com/example
```

```json
{
  "text": "More than X% of your hosts have not checked into Fleet
           for more than X days. Youâ€™ve been sent this message
           because the Host status webhook is enabeld in your Fleet
           instance.",
  "data": {
    "unseen_hosts": 1,
    "total_hosts": 2,
    "days_unseen": 3,
  }
}
```

To enable and configure host status automations, navigate to **Settings > Organization settings > Host
status webhook** in the Fleet UI.
