# Mobile device management (MDM)

MDM features are not ready for production and are currently in development. These features are disabled by default.

MDM features allow you to manage macOS updates and macOS settings on your hosts.

To use MDM features you have to connect Fleet to Apple Push Certificates Portal. See how [here](#apple-push-notification-service-apns).

## Controls

### macOS updates

Fleet uses [Nudge](https://github.com/macadmins/nudge) to encourage the installation of macOS updates.

When a minimum version and deadline is saved in Fleet, the end user sees the below window until their macOS version is at or above the minimum version.

![Fleet's architecture diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fleetdm/fleet/main/docs/images/nudge-window.png)

As the deadline gets closer, Fleet provides stronger encouragement.

If the end user has more than 1 day until the deadline, the window is shown everyday. The end user can defer the update and close the window. They’ll see the window again the next day.

If there is less than 1 day, the window is shown every 2 hours. The end user can defer and they'll see the window again in 2 hours.

If the end user is past the deadline, Fleet opens the window. The end user can't close the window.

## Apple Push Notification Service (APNs)

To connect Fleet to Apple, get these four files using the Fleet UI or the `fleetctl` command-line interface: An APNs certificate, APNs private key, Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol (SCEP) certificate, and SCEP private key.

To do this, choose the "Fleet UI" or "fleetctl" method and follow the steps below.

Fleet UI:
1. Head to the **Settings > Integrations > Mobile device management (MDM)** page. Users with the admin role can access the settings pages.
2. Follow the instructions under **Apple Push Certificates Portal**.

`fleetctl` CLI:
1. Run `fleetctl generate mdm-apple --email <email> --org <org>`.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions.

> Take note of the Apple ID you use to sign into Apple Push Certificates Portal. You'll need to use the same Apple ID when renewing your APNs certificate. Apple requires that APNs certificates are renewed once every year. To renew, see the [APNs Renewal section](#apns-renewal) .

### APNs Renewal

Apple requires that APNs certificates are renewed once every year. You can see the certificate's renewal date and other important APNs information using the Fleet UI or the `fleetctl` command-line interface:

Fleet UI:
1. Head to the **Settings > Integrations > Mobile device management (MDM)** page. Users with the admin role can access the settings pages.
2. Look at the **Apple Push Certificates Portal** section.

`fleetctl` CLI:
1. Run `fleetctl get mdm-apple`.
2. Look at the on-screen information.

How to renew the certificate if it's expired or about to expire:

1. Run the `fleetctl generate mdm-apple --email <email> --org <org>` command. Make sure you use the same Apple ID email address that you used when generating the original certificate.
2. Sign in to [Apple Push Certificates Portal](https://identity.apple.com) using the same Apple ID you used to get your original certificate. If you don't use the same Apple ID, you will have to turn MDM off and back on for all macOS hosts.
3. In the **Settings > Integrations > Mobile device management (MDM)** page, under Apple Push Certificates portal, find the serial number of your current certificate. In Apple Push Certificates Portal, click  **Renew** next to the certificate that has the matching serial number. If you don't renew and get a new certificate, you will have to turn MDM off and back on for all macOS hosts.

## Apple Business Manager (ABM)

_Available in Fleet Premium_

Connect Fleet to your ABM account to automatically enroll macOS hosts to Fleet when they’re first unboxed.

To connect Fleet to ABM, get these four files using the Fleet UI or the `fleetctl` command-line interface: An ABM certificate, private key and server token.

To do this, choose the "Fleet UI" or "fleetctl" method and follow the steps below.

Fleet UI:
1. In the Fleet UI, head to the **Settings > Integrations > Mobile device management (MDM)** page. Users with the admin role can access the settings pages.
2. Follow the instructions under **Apple Business Manager**.

`fleetctl` CLI:
1. Run `fleetctl generate mdm-apple-bm`.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions.

### ABM Renewal

The Apple Business Manager server token expires after a year or whenever the account that downloaded the token has their password changed. To renew the token, follow the [instructions documented in this FAQ](https://fleetdm.com/docs/using-fleet/faq#how-can-i-renew-my-apple-business-manager-server-token).

## Disk encryption

In Fleet, you can turn on disk encryption on your macOS hosts. Apple calls this [FileVault](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204837). If turned on, hosts’ disk encryption keys will be stored in Fleet.

The disk encryption key allows you to unlock a Mac if you forgot login credentials. This key can be accessed by Fleet admin, maintainers, and observers. An event is tracked in the activity feed when a user views the key in Fleet.

### Viewing a disk encryption key

To view the disk encryption key, select a host on the **Hosts** page. On the **Host details** page, select **Actions > Show disk encryption key**.

### Unlock a device using the disk encryption key

1. Restart the device while holding Command + R

2. Open Terminal

3. Unlock the disk encryption key by executing a command similar to:
```
security unlock-keychain <path to the secure copy of the 
FileVaultMaster.keychain file>
```

4. Locate the Logical Volume UUID of the encrypted disk by executing:
```
diskutil cs list
```

5. Unlock the encrypted drive with the Logical Volume UUID and disk encryption key by executing a command similar to:
```
diskutil cs unlockVolume <UUID> -recoveryKeychain <path to the secure copy of the FileVaultMaster.keychain file>
```
6. Turn off disk encryption by executing a command similar to: 
```
diskutil cs revert <UUID> -recoveryKeychain <path to the secure copy of the FileVaultMaster.keychain file>
```

Once successful, you can reset the account password using the Reset Password utility and recover data by either logging in to the user’s account or using the command line.

1. Restart the device while pressing Command + R.

2. Open Terminal and launch the Reset Password utility by executing:
```
resetpassword
```

3. Use the Reset Password utility to reset the account’s password.

4. Restart the computer and log in using the new password.
