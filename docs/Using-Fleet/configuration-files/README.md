Fleet can be managed with configuration files (YAML syntax) and the fleetctl command line tool. This page tells you how to write these configuration files.

Changes are applied to Fleet when the configuration file is applied using fleetctl. Check out the [fleetctl documentation](https://fleetdm.com/docs/using-fleet/fleetctl-cli#using-fleetctl-to-configure-fleet) to learn how to apply configuration files.

## Queries

The `query` YAML file controls queries in Fleet.

You can define one or more queries in the same file with with `---`.

The following example file includes several queries:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: query
spec:
  name: osquery_schedule
  description: Report performance stats for each file in the query schedule.
  query: select name, interval, executions, output_size, wall_time, (user_time/executions) as avg_user_time, (system_time/executions) as avg_system_time, average_memory, last_executed from osquery_schedule;
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: query
spec:
  name: osquery_info
  description: A heartbeat counter that reports general performance (CPU, memory) and version.
  query: select i.*, p.resident_size, p.user_time, p.system_time, time.minutes as counter from osquery_info i, processes p, time where p.pid = i.pid;
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: query
spec:
  name: osquery_events
  description: Report event publisher health and track event counters.
  query: select name, publisher, type, subscriptions, events, active from osquery_events;
```

Continued edits and applications to this file will update the queries.

If you want to change the name of a query, you must first create a new query with the new name and then delete the query with the old name.

### Labels

The following file describes the labels which hosts should be automatically grouped into. The label resource should include the actual SQL query so that the label is self-contained:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: label
spec:
  name: slack_not_running
  query: >
    SELECT * FROM system_info
    WHERE NOT EXISTS (
      SELECT *
      FROM processes
      WHERE name LIKE "%Slack%"
    );
```

Labels can also be "manually managed". When defining the label, reference hosts
by hostname:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: label
spec:
  name: Manually Managed Example
  label_membership_type: manual
  hosts:
    - hostname1
    - hostname2
    - hostname3
```

## Enroll secrets

The following file shows how to configure enroll secrets.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: enroll_secret
spec:
  secrets:
    - secret: RzTlxPvugG4o4O5IKS/HqEDJUmI1hwBoffff
    - secret: YBh0n4pvRplKyWiowv9bf3zp6BBOJ13O
```

## Teams

**Applies only to Fleet Premium**.

The `team` YAML file controls a team in Fleet.

You can define one or more teams in the same file with with `---`.

The following example file includes one team:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: team
spec:
  team:
    name: Client Platform Engineering
    features:
      enable_host_users: false
      enable_software_inventory: true
      additional_queries:
        time: SELECT * FROM time
        macs: SELECT mac FROM interface_details
    agent_options:
      config:
        decorators:
          load:
            - SELECT uuid AS host_uuid FROM system_info;
            - SELECT hostname AS hostname FROM system_info;
        options:
          disable_distributed: false
          distributed_interval: 10
          distributed_plugin: tls
          distributed_tls_max_attempts: 3
          logger_plugin: tls
          logger_tls_endpoint: /api/v1/osquery/log
          logger_tls_period: 10
          pack_delimiter: /
      overrides: {}
      command_line_flags: {}
    secrets:
      - secret: RzTlxPvugG4o4O5IKS/HqEDJUmI1hwBoffff
      - secret: JZ/C/Z7ucq22dt/zjx2kEuDBN0iLjqfz
```

### Team settings

#### Team agent options

The team agent options specify options that only apply to this team. When team-specific agent options have been specified, the agent options specified at the organization level are ignored for this team.

The documentation for this section is identical to the [Agent options](#agent-options) documentation for the organization settings, except that the YAML section where it is set must be as follows. (Note the `kind: team` key and the location of the `agent_options` key under `team` must have a `name` key to identify the team to configure.)

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: team
spec:
  team:
    name: Client Platform Engineering
    agent_options:
      # the team-specific options go here
```

#### Secrets

The `secrets` section provides the list of enroll secrets that will be valid for this team. If the section is missing, the existing secrets are left unmodified. Otherwise, they are replaced with this list of secrets for this team.

- Optional setting (array of dictionaries)
- Default value: none (empty)
- Config file format:
  ```
  team:
    name: Client Platform Engineering
    secrets:
      - secret: RzTlxPvugG4o4O5IKS/HqEDJUmI1hwBoffff
      - secret: JZ/C/Z7ucq22dt/zjx2kEuDBN0iLjqfz
  ```

## Organization settings

The `config` YAML file controls Fleet's organization settings.

The following example file shows the default organization settings:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: config
spec:
  agent_options:
    config:
      decorators:
        load:
          - SELECT uuid AS host_uuid FROM system_info;
          - SELECT hostname AS hostname FROM system_info;
      options:
        disable_distributed: false
        distributed_interval: 10
        distributed_plugin: tls
        distributed_tls_max_attempts: 3
        logger_plugin: tls
        logger_tls_endpoint: /api/osquery/log
        logger_tls_period: 10
        pack_delimiter: /
    overrides: {}
    command_line_flags: {}
  features:
    enable_host_users: true
    enable_software_inventory: true
  fleet_desktop:
    transparency_url: https://fleetdm.com/transparency

    vulnerabilities_webhook:
      destination_url: ""
      enable_vulnerabilities_webhook: false
      host_batch_size: 0
```

### Settings

All possible settings are organized below by section.

Each section's key must be one level below the `spec` key, indented with spaces (not `<tab>` charaters) as required by the YAML format.

For example, when adding the `host_expiry_settings.host_expiry_enabled` setting, you'd specify the `host_expiry_settings` section one level below the `spec` key:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: config
spec:
  host_expiry_settings:
    host_expiry_enabled: true
```

#### Features

The `features` section of the configuration YAML lets you define what predefined queries are sent to the hosts and later on processed by Fleet for different functionalities.

> Note: this section used to be named `host_settings`, but was renamed in Fleet v4.20.0,
> `host_settings` is still supported for backwards compatibility.

##### features.additional_queries

This is the additional information to collect from hosts along with the host details. This information will be updated at the same time as other host details and is returned by the API when host objects are returned. Users must take care to keep the data returned by these queries small in order to mitigate potential performance impacts on the Fleet server.

- Optional setting (dictionary of key-value strings)
- Default value: none (empty)
- Config file format:
  ```yaml
  features:
    additional_queries:
      time: SELECT * FROM time
      macs: SELECT mac FROM interface_details
  ```
- Deprecated config file format:
  ```yaml
  host_settings:
    additional_queries:
      time: SELECT * FROM time
      macs: SELECT mac FROM interface_details
  ```

##### features.enable_host_users

Whether or not Fleet sends the query needed to gather user-related data from hosts.

- Optional setting (boolean)
- Default value: `true`
- Config file format:
  ```yaml
  features:
  	enable_host_users: false
  ```
- Deprecated config file format:
  ```yaml
  host_settings:
  	enable_host_users: false
  ```

##### features.enable_software_inventory

Whether or not Fleet sends the query needed to gather the list of software installed on hosts, along with other metadata.

- Optional setting (boolean)
- Default value: `true`
- Config file format:
  ```yaml
  features:
  	enable_software_inventory: false
  ```
- Deprecated config file format:
  ```yaml
  host_settings:
  	enable_software_inventory: false
  ```

#### Fleet Desktop

For more information about Fleet Desktop, see [Fleet Desktop's documentation](https://fleetdm.com/docs/using-fleet/fleet-desktop).

##### fleet_desktop.transparency_url

**Available in Fleet Premium**. Direct users of Fleet Desktop to a custom transparency URL page.

- Optional setting (string)
- Default value: Fleet's default transparency URL ("https://fleetdm.com/transparency")
- Config file format:
  ```yaml
  fleet_desktop:
    transparency_url: "https://example.org/transparency"
  ```

#### Host expiry settings

The `host_expiry_settings` section lets you define if and when hosts should be removed from Fleet if they have not checked in. Once a host has been removed from Fleet, it will need to re-enroll with a valid `enroll_secret` to connect to your Fleet instance.

##### host_expiry_settings.host_expiry_enabled

Whether offline hosts' expiration is enabled. If `host_expiry_enabled` is set to `true`, Fleet allows automatic cleanup of hosts that have not communicated with Fleet in some number of days.

- Optional setting (boolean)
- Default value: `false`
- Config file format:
  ```yaml
  host_expiry_settings:
  	host_expiry_enabled: true
  ```

##### host_expiry_settings.host_expiry_window

If a host has not communicated with Fleet in the specified number of days, it will be removed.

- Optional setting (integer)
- Default value: `0` (must be > 0 when enabling host expiry)
- Config file format:
  ```yaml
  host_expiry_settings:
  	host_expiry_window: 10
  ```

#### Integrations

For more information about integrations and Fleet automations in general, see the [Automations documentation](https://fleetdm.com/docs/using-fleet/automations). Only one automation can be enabled for a given automation type (e.g., for failing policies, only one of the webhooks, the Jira integration, or the Zendesk automation can be enabled).

It's recommended to use the Fleet UI to configure integrations since secret credentials (in the form of an API token) must be provided. See the [Automations documentation](https://fleetdm.com/docs/using-fleet/automations) for the UI configuration steps.

#### Organization information

##### org_info.org_name

The name of the organization.

- Required setting (string)
- Default value: none (provided during Fleet setup)
- Config file format:
  ```yaml
  org_info:
  	org_name: Fleet
  ```

##### org_info.org_logo_url

The URL of the logo of the organization.

- Optional setting (string)
- Default value: none (uses Fleet's logo)
- Config file format:
  ```yaml
  org_info:
  	org_logo_url: https://example.com/logo.png
  ```

#### Server settings

##### server_settings.debug_host_ids

There's a lot of information coming from hosts, but it's sometimes useful to see exactly what a host is returning in order
to debug different scenarios.

For example, let's say the hosts with ids 342 and 98 are not behaving as you expect in Fleet. You can enable verbose
logging with the following configuration:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: config
spec:
  server_settings:
    debug_host_ids:
      - 342
      - 98
```

Once you have collected the logs, you can easily disable the debug logging by applying the following configuration:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: config
spec:
  server_settings:
    debug_host_ids: []
```

> **Warning:** This will potentially log a lot of data. Some of that data might be private. Please verify it before posting it
in a public channel or a GitHub issue.

- Optional setting (array of integers)
- Default value: empty
- Config file format:
  ```
  server_settings:
    debug_host_ids:
      - 342
      - 98
  ```

##### server_settings.deferred_save_host

Whether saving host-related information is done synchronously in the HTTP handler of the host's request, or asynchronously. This can provide better performance in deployments with many hosts. Note that this is an **experimental feature**.

- Config file format:
  ```yaml
  server_settings:
    server_url: https://fleet.example.org:8080
  ```

#### SMTP settings

It's recommended to use the Fleet UI to configure SMTP since a secret password must be provided. Navigate to **Settings -> Organization settings -> SMTP Options** to proceed with this configuration.

Defines whether to enable the failing policies webhook. Note that currently, if the failing policies webhook and the `osquery.enable_async_host_processing` options are set, some failing policies webhooks could be missing. Some transitions from succeeding to failing or vice-versa could happen without triggering a webhook request.

- Optional setting (boolean).
- Default value: `false`.
- Config file format:
  ```yaml
  webhook_settings:
    failing_policies_webhook:
      enable_failing_policies_webhook: true
  ```

###### webhook_settings.failing_policies_webhook.host_batch_size

Note that the recent vulnerabilities webhook is not checked at `webhook_settings.interval` like other webhooks. It is checked as part of the vulnerability processing and runs at the `vulnerabilities.periodicity` interval specified in the [fleet configuration](https://fleetdm.com/docs/deploying/configuration#periodicity).

###### webhook_settings.vulnerabilities_webhook.destination_url

The URL to `POST` to when the condition for the webhook triggers.

- Default value: `0`.
- Config file format:
  ```yaml
  webhook_settings:
    vulnerabilities_webhook:
      host_batch_size: 100
  ```

#### Agent options

The `agent_options` key controls the settings applied to the agent on all your hosts. These settings are applied when each host checks in.

See the [osquery documentation](https://osquery.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation/cli-flags/#configuration-control-flags) for the available options. This document shows all examples in command line flag format. Remove the dashed lines (`--`) for Fleet to successfully update the setting. For example, use `distributed_interval` instead of `--distributed_interval`.

Agent options are validated using the latest version of osquery. 

You can verify that your agent options are valid by using [the fleetctl apply command](https://fleetdm.com/docs/using-fleet/fleetctl-cli#fleetctl-apply) with the `--dry-run` flag. This will report any error and do nothing if the configuration was valid. If you don't use the latest version of osquery, you can override validation using the `--force` flag. This will update agent options even if they are invalid.

Existing options will be overwritten by the application of this file.

##### Overrides option

The `overrides` key allows you to segment hosts, by their platform, and supply these groups with unique osquery configuration options. When you choose to use the overrides option for a specific platform, all options specified in the default configuration will be ignored for that platform.

In the example file below, all Darwin and Ubuntu hosts will only receive the options specified in their respective overrides sections.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: config
spec:
  agent_options:
    config:
      options:
        distributed_interval: 3
        distributed_tls_max_attempts: 3
        logger_plugin: tls
        logger_tls_endpoint: /api/osquery/log
        logger_tls_period: 10
      decorators:
        load:
          - "SELECT version FROM osquery_info"
          - "SELECT uuid AS host_uuid FROM system_info"
        always:
          - "SELECT user AS username FROM logged_in_users WHERE user <> '' ORDER BY time LIMIT 1"
        interval:
          3600: "SELECT total_seconds AS uptime FROM uptime"
    overrides:
      # Note configs in overrides take precedence over the default config defined
      # under the config key above. Hosts receive overrides based on the platform
      # returned by `SELECT platform FROM os_version`. In this example, the base
      # config would be used for Windows and CentOS hosts, while Mac and Ubuntu
      # hosts would receive their respective overrides. Note, these overrides are
      # NOT merged with the top level configuration.

##### Auto table construction

You can use Fleet to query local SQLite databases as tables. For more information on creating ATC configuration from a SQLite database, check out the [Automatic Table Construction section](https://osquery.readthedocs.io/en/stable/deployment/configuration/#automatic-table-construction) of the osquery documentation.

If you already know what your ATC configuration needs to look like, you can add it to an options config file:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: config
spec:
  agent_options:
    config:
      options:
        # ...
    overrides:
      platforms:
        darwin:
          auto_table_construction:
            tcc_system_entries:
              query: "SELECT service, client, allowed, prompt_count, last_modified FROM access"
              path: "/Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db"
              columns:
                - "service"
                - "client"
                - "allowed"
                - "prompt_count"
                - "last_modified"
```

##### YARA configuration

You can use Fleet to configure the `yara` and `yara_events` osquery tables. Fore more information on YARA configuration and continuous monitoring using the `yara_events` table, check out the [YARA-based scanning with osquery section](https://osquery.readthedocs.io/en/stable/deployment/yara/) of the osquery documentation.

The following is an example Fleet configuration file with YARA configuration. The values are taken from an example config supplied in the above link to the osquery documentation.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: config
spec:
  agent_options:
    config:
      # ...
      yara:
        file_paths:
          system_binaries:
          - sig_group_1
          tmp:
          - sig_group_1
          - sig_group_2
        signatures:
          sig_group_1:
          - /Users/wxs/sigs/foo.sig
          - /Users/wxs/sigs/bar.sig
          sig_group_2:
          - /Users/wxs/sigs/baz.sig
    overrides: {}
```

#### Advanced configuration

> **Note:** More settings are included in the [contributor documentation](https://fleetdm.com/docs/contributing/configuration-for-contributors). It's possible, although not recommended, to configure these settings in the YAML configuration file.
