# Fleet Desktop

Fleet Desktop is a menubar icon available on macOS, Windows, and Linux. 

At its core, Fleet Desktop gives your end users visibility into the security posture of their machine. This unlocks two key benefits:
* Self-remediation: end users can see which policies they are failing and resolution steps, reducing the need for IT and security teams to intervene
* Scope Transparency: end users can see what the Fleet agent can do on their machines, eliminating ambiguity between end users and their IT and security teams
