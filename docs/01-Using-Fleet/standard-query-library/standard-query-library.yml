    Automated method:
    Ask your system administrator to deploy an MDM profile that ensures a password is required to wake the computer from sleep or screen saver is enabled.
    Graphical method:
      Perform the following steps to ensure a password is required to wake the computer from sleep or screen saver is enabled:
        1. Open System Settings
        2. Select Lock Screen
        3. Verify that "Require password after screensaver begins or display is turned
        off" is set with "After 0 seconds" or "After 5 seconds"
