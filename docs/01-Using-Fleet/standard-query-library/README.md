# Standard query library

Fleet's [standard query library](https://fleetdm.com/queries) includes a growing collection of useful policies and miscellaneous queries for organizations deploying Fleet and osquery.

## Importing the queries in Fleet

After cloning the fleetdm/fleet repo, import the queries and policies found in `docs/01-Using-Fleet/standard-query-library/standard-query-library.yml` using [fleetctl](https://fleetdm.com/docs/using-fleet/fleetctl-cli):

```sh
fleetctl apply -f docs/01-Using-Fleet/standard-query-library/standard-query-library.yml
```
