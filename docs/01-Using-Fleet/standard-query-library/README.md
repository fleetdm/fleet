# Standard query library

Fleet's standard query library includes a growing collection of useful queries for organizations deploying Fleet and osquery.

## Importing the queries in Fleet

### After cloning the fleetdm/fleet repo, import the queries using fleetctl:
```
fleetctl apply -f docs/01-Using-Fleet/standard-query-library/standard-query-library.yml
```
