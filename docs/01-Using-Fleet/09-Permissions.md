## Team member permissions

`Applies only to Fleet Premium`

```
ℹ️  In Fleet 4.0, the Teams feature was introduced.
```

Users either have global access or team access in Fleet. Users with global access can observe and act on all hosts in Fleet. Check out [the user permissions table](#user-permissions) above for global user permissions.

Users with team access can only observe and act on hosts that are assigned to their team.

Users can be a member of multiple teams in Fleet.

Users that are members of multiple teams can be assigned different roles for each team. For example, a user can be given access to the "Workstations" team and assigned the "Observer" role. This same user can be given access to the "Servers" team and assigned the "Maintainer" role.

The following table depicts various permissions levels in a team.
