## Team member permissions

`Applies only to Fleet Premium`

```
ℹ️  In Fleet 4.0, the Teams feature was introduced.
```

Users either have global access to Fleet or team access to Fleet. Check out [the user permissions table](#user-permissions) above for global user permissions.

Users can be a member of multiple teams in Fleet.

Users that are members of multiple teams can be assigned different roles for each team. For example, a user can be given access to the "Workstations" team and assigned the "Observer" role. This same user can be given access to the "Servers" team and assigned the "Maintainer" role.

The following table depicts various permissions levels in a team.
