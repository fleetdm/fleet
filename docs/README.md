# Fleet Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for the Fleet osquery fleet manager.

- Resources for using the Fleet UI, fleetctl CLI, and Fleet REST API can all be found in [Using Fleet](./1-Using-Fleet/README.md).
- Resources for installing Fleet's infrastructure dependencies, configuring Fleet, deploying osquery to hosts, and viewing example deployment scenarios can all be found in [Deployment](./2-Deployment/README.md).
- Finally, if you're interested in interacting with the Fleet source code, you will find information on modifying and building the code in [Contribution](./3-Contribution/README.md).

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to [File a GitHub issue](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/issues) or [join us on Slack](https://osquery.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-h29zm0gk-s2DBtGUTW4CFel0f0IjTEw#/). You can find us in the `#fleet` channel.
