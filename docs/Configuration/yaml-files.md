# YAML files

Use Fleet's best practice GitOps workflow to manage your computers as code.

To learn how to set up a GitOps workflow see the [Fleet GitOps repo](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet-gitops).

## File structure

- `default.yml`- File where you define the queries, policies, controls, and agent options for all hosts. If you're using Fleet Premium, this file updates queries and policies that run on all hosts ("All teams"). Controls and agent options are defined for hosts on "No team."
- `teams/` - Folder where you define your teams in Fleet. These `teams/team-name.yml` files define the controls, queries, policies, and agent options for hosts assigned to the specified team. Teams are available in Fleet Premium.
- `lib/` - Folder where you define policies, queries, configuration profiles, scripts, and agent options. These files can be referenced in top level keys in the `default.yml` file and the files in the `teams/` folder.
- `.github/workflows/workflow.yml` - The GitHub workflow file where you can add [environment variables](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/variables#defining-environment-variables-for-a-single-workflow).

The following files are responsible for running the GitHub action. Most users don't need to edit these files.
- `gitops.sh` - The bash script that applies the latest configuration to Fleet. This script is used in the GitHub action file.
- `.github/gitops-action/action.yml` - The GitHub action that runs `gitops.sh`. This action is used in the GitHub workflow file. It can also be used in other workflows.

## Configuration options

The following are the required keys in the `default.yml` and any `teams/team-name.yml` files:

```yaml
name: # Only teams/team-name.yml. To edit a team's name, change `name` but don't change the filename.
policies:
queries:
agent_options:
controls:
software:
org_settings: # Only default.yml
team_settings: # Only teams/team-name.yml
```

- [policies](#policies)
- [queries](#queries)
- [agent_options](#agent-options)
- [controls](#controls)
- [software](#software)
- [org_settings and team_settings](#org-settings-and-team-settings)

### policies

### software

> **Experimental feature**. This feature is undergoing rapid improvement, which may result in breaking changes to the API or configuration surface. It is not recommended for use in automated workflows.

- `self_service` specifies whether or not end users can install from **Fleet Desktop > Self-service**.

#### app_store_apps

- `app_store_id` is the ID of the Apple App Store app. You can find this at the end of the app's App Store URL. For example, "Bear - Markdown Notes" URL is "https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bear-markdown-notes/id1016366447" and the `app_store_id` is `1016366447`.

### org_settings and team_settings
