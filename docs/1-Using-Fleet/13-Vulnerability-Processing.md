## What to expect

Vulnerability processing is currently in beta.

At the moment, Fleet only checks for vulnerabilities against the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). The way it works is by 
first translating the software from each host into a CPE (Common Platform Enumeration) representation of the name.

With this CPE, we search the full list of CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) from NVD to detect the CVEs matching
the defined CPE. If any matches are found, they are exposed through the API for describing a host and through the
web frontend in the host details section.

These checks are performed in one Fleet instance. If your Fleet deployment uses multiple instances, only one will be doing
this work.

In order to do all this, Fleet downloads the following files:

1. A preprocessed CPE database generated by FleetDM to speed up the translation process: https://github.com/fleetdm/nvd/releases
2. The historical data for all CVEs and how to match to a CPE: from https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/data-feeds

The database generated in 1 is processed from the original official CPE dictionary https://nvd.nist.gov/products/cpe. It's
updated once a day at most, depending on whether there's new data.

The matching occurs server-side to make the processing as fast as possible, but the whole process is both CPU and memory intensive.
For example, when running a development instance of Fleet on an Apple Macbook Pro with 16 cores, matching 200k CPEs against the CVE
database will take around 10 seconds and consume about 3GBs of RAM. The CPU and memory usages are in burst once every hour on the 
instance that does the processing.

## Setup

Vulnerability checking is disabled by default. In order to enable it, you need to enable the software inventory feature 
by setting the following environment variable:

```
FLEET_BETA_SOFTWARE_INVENTORY=1
```

Or through the app config:

```
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: config
spec:
  host_settings:
    enable_software_inventory: true
```

Fleet also needs a path where it will download the different data feeds. This can be done through the Fleet server config
YAML:

```
echo '
... rest of your config here
vulnerabilities:
  databases_path: /some/path
' > /tmp/fleet.yml
fleet serve --config /tmp/fleet.yml
```

Or through environment variables:

```
FLEET_VULNERABILITIES_DATABASES_PATH=/some/path
```

The path specified needs to exist and Fleet needs to be able to read and write to and from it. This is the only mandatory
configuration needed for vulnerability processing to work. Additional options, like vulnerability check frequency, can be
found in the [configuration documentation](../2-Deploying/2-Configuration.md#vulnerabilities).

You'll need to restart the Fleet instances after changing these settings.
