# Why Fleet

## What's it for?

In an industry that views security and IT as a shopping spree rather than a process, it's little wonder that IT and security teams get stuck with bolt-on solutions, misconfigured tools, and disparate workflows. 

Fleet helps organizations like Fastly and Gusto reimagine the "easy button." 

By simplifying how they do device health, FIM, HIDS, posture assessment, malware detection, vulnerability management, MDM, and the rest, Fleet's API enables teams with thousands of computers to build an IT and security program that works.

### Explore data
To see what kind of data you can use Fleet to gather, you can check out the [table reference documentation](https://fleetdm.com/tables).

### Out-of-the-box policies
Fleet includes out-of-the-box support for all [CIS benchmarks for macOS and Windows](https://fleetdm.com/pricing), as well as many [simpler queries](https://fleetdm.com/queries).

Take as much or as little as you need for your organization.

### Supported platforms
Here are the platforms Fleet currently supports:

- Linux (all distros)
- macOS
- Windows
- Chromebooks
- Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- Google Cloud (GCP)
- Azure (Microsoft cloud)
- Data centers
- Containers (kube, etc)
- Linux-based IoT devices

## Lighter than air
Fleet is lightweight and modular.  You can use it for security without using it for MDM, and vice versa.  You can turn off features you are not using.

### Open by design
Fleet is dedicated to flexibility, accessibility, and clarity.  We think [everyone can contribute](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company#openness) and that tools should be as easy as possible for everyone to understand.

### Good neighbors
Ready-to-use, enterprise-friendly [integrations](https://fleetdm.com/integrations) exist for Snowflake, Splunk, GitHub Actions, Vanta, Elastic Jira, Zendesk, and more.

Fleet plays well with Munki, Chef, Puppet, and Ansible, as well as with security tools like Crowdstrike and SentinelOne.  For example, you can use the free version of Fleet to quickly report on what hosts are _actually_ running your EDR agent.


### Free as in free
The free version of Fleet will [always be free](https://fleetdm.com/pricing).  Fleet is [independently backed](https://linkedin.com/company/fleetdm) and actively maintained with the help of many amazing [contributors](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/graphs/contributors).

### Longevity
The [company behind Fleet](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company) is founded (and majority-owned) by [true believers in open source](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/why-this-way#why-open-source).  The company's business model is influenced by GitLab (NYSE: GTLB), with great investors, happy customers, and the capacity to become profitable at any time.

In keeping with Fleet's value of openness, [Fleet Device Management's company handbook](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company) is public and open source.  You can read about the [history of Fleet and osquery](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company#history) and our commitment to improving the product.
