# Why Fleet

Fleet is an open-source device management platform for Linux, macOS, Windows, Chromebooks, and iOS devices (BYOD or corporate owned.)

## What's it for?

Managing computers today is getting harder. You have to juggle a mix of operating systems and devices, with a bunch of middleman vendors in between. 

Fleet makes things easier by giving you a single system to secure and maintain all your computing devices over the air. You can do MDM, patch stuff, and verify anything—all from one system. It's like having a universal remote control for all your organization's computers.

Fleet is open source, and free features will always be free.

## Is it any good?

Fleet is used in production by IT and security teams with thousands of laptops and servers. Many deployments support tens of thousands of hosts, and a few large organizations manage deployments as large as 400,000+ hosts.

- **Get what you need:** Fleet lets you work directly with [data](https://fleetdm.com/integrations) and events from the native operating system. It lets you go all the way down to the bare metal. It’s also modular. (You can turn off features you are not using.)
- **Out of the box:** Ready-to-use integrations exist for the [most common tools](https://fleetdm.com/integrations). You can also build custom workflows with the REST API, webhook events, and the fleetctl command line tool. Or go all in and govern computers [with GitOps](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet-gitops).
- **Good neighbors:** We think tools should be as easy as possible for everyone to understand. We helped [create osquery](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company#history), and we are committed to improving it.
- **Free as in free:** The free version of Fleet will [always be free](https://fleetdm.com/pricing). Fleet is independently backed and actively maintained with the help of many amazing contributors.
