Remaining TODO

- access for global observers:
  - from settings list
  - no 'Add label' button
- Header
  - top margin
  - subheader distance to header
- delete label modal
- actions:
  - click through to filtered hosts page
  - no edit or delete for < admins
- columns
  - add sort arrows (functionality is working)
  - type
    - should be sourced from `label.membership_type`, not `label.type`
    - should exclude `label.type == builtin`
- Actions menu only visible on row hover
