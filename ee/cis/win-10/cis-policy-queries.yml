spec:
  name: CIS - Ensure 'Account lockout duration' is set to '15 or more minute(s)' (Automated)

  platforms: win10
  platform: windows
  description: |
    This policy setting determines the length of time that must pass before a locked account is unlocked and a user can try to log on again. The setting does this by specifying the number of minutes a locked out account will remain unavailable. If the value for this policy setting is configured to 0, locked out accounts will remain locked out until an administrator manually unlocks them.
    Although it might seem like a good idea to configure the value for this policy setting to a high value, such a configuration will likely increase the number of calls that the help desk receives to unlock accounts locked by mistake. Users should be aware of the length of time a lock remains in place, so that they realize they only need to call the help desk if they have an extremely urgent need to regain access to their computer.
    The recommended state for this setting is: 15 or more minute(s).
    Note: Password Policy settings (section 1.1) and Account Lockout Policy settings (section 1.2) must be applied via the Default Domain Policy GPO in order to be globally in effect on domain user accounts as their default behavior. If these settings are configured in another GPO, they will only affect local user accounts on the computers that receive the GPO. However, custom exceptions to the default password policy and account lockout policy rules for specific domain users and/or groups can be defined using Password Settings Objects (PSOs), which are completely separate from Group Policy and most easily configured using Active Directory Administrative Center.
    Rationale:
    A denial of service (DoS) condition can be created if an attacker abuses the Account lockout threshold and repeatedly attempts to log on with a specific account. Once you configure the Account lockout threshold setting, the account will be locked out after the specified number of failed attempts. If you configure the Account lockout duration setting to 0, then the account will remain locked out until an administrator unlocks it manually.

1.2.2 (L1) Ensure 'Account lockout threshold' is set to '5 or fewer invalid logon attempt(s), but not 0' (Automated)

  description: |
	This policy setting determines the number of failed logon attempts before the account is locked. Setting this policy to 0 does not conform to the benchmark as doing so disables the account lockout threshold.
	The recommended state for this setting is: 5 or fewer invalid logon attempt(s), but not 0.
	Note: Password Policy settings (section 1.1) and Account Lockout Policy settings (section 1.2) must be applied via the Default Domain Policy GPO in order to be globally in effect on domain user accounts as their default behavior. If these settings are configured in another GPO, they will only affect local user accounts on the computers that receive the GPO. However, custom exceptions to the default password policy and account lockout policy rules for specific domain users and/or groups can be defined using Password Settings Objects (PSOs), which are completely separate from Group Policy and most easily configured using Active Directory Administrative Center.
	Rationale:
	Setting an account lockout threshold reduces the likelihood that an online password brute force attack will be successful. Setting the account lockout threshold too low introduces risk of increased accidental lockouts and/or a malicious actor intentionally locking out accounts.

1.2.3 (L1) Ensure 'Reset account lockout counter after' is set to '15 or more minute(s)' (Automated)

  description: |
	This policy setting determines the length of time before the Account lockout threshold resets to zero. The default value for this policy setting is Not Defined. If the Account lockout threshold is defined, this reset time must be less than or equal to the value for the Account lockout duration setting.
	If you leave this policy setting at its default value or configure the value to an interval that is too long, your environment could be vulnerable to a DoS attack. An attacker could maliciously perform a number of failed logon attempts on all users in the organization, which will lock out their accounts. If no policy were determined to reset the account lockout, it would be a manual task for administrators. Conversely, if a reasonable time value is configured for this policy setting, users would be locked out for a set period until all of the accounts are unlocked automatically.
	The recommended state for this setting is: 15 or more minute(s).
	Note: Password Policy settings (section 1.1) and Account Lockout Policy settings (section 1.2) must be applied via the Default Domain Policy GPO in order to be globally in effect on domain user accounts as their default behavior. If these settings are configured in another GPO, they will only affect local user accounts on the computers that receive the GPO. However, custom exceptions to the default password policy and account lockout policy rules for specific domain users and/or groups can be defined using Password Settings Objects (PSOs), which are completely separate from Group Policy and most easily configured using Active Directory Administrative Center.
	Rationale:
	Users can accidentally lock themselves out of their accounts if they mistype their password multiple times. To reduce the chance of such accidental lockouts, the Reset account lockout counter after setting determines the number of minutes that must elapse before the counter that tracks failed logon attempts and triggers lockouts is reset to 0.

2.2.2 (L1) Ensure 'Access this computer from the network' is set to 'Administrators, Remote Desktop Users' (Automated)

  description: |
	This policy setting allows other users on the network to connect to the computer and is required by various network protocols that include Server Message Block (SMB)-based protocols, NetBIOS, Common Internet File System (CIFS), and Component Object Model Plus (COM+).
	The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators, Remote Desktop Users.
	Rationale:
	Users who can connect from their computer to the network can access resources on target computers for which they have permission. For example, the Access this computer from the network user right is required for users to connect to shared printers and folders. If this user right is assigned to the Everyone group, then anyone will be able to read the files in those shared folders. However, this situation is unlikely for new installations of Windows Server 2003 with Service Pack 1 (SP1), because the default share and NTFS permissions in Windows Server 2003 do not include the Everyone group. This vulnerability may have a higher level of risk for computers that you upgrade from Windows NT 4.0 or Windows 2000, because the default permissions for these operating systems are not as restrictive as the default permissions in Windows Server 2003.

	This policy setting determines which users and groups can change the time and date on the internal clock of the computers in your environment. Users who are assigned this user right can affect the appearance of event logs. When a computer's time setting is changed, logged events reflect the new time, not the actual time that the events occurred.
	The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators, LOCAL SERVICE.
	Note: Discrepancies between the time on the local computer and on the Domain Controllers in your environment may cause problems for the Kerberos authentication protocol, which could make it impossible for users to log on to the domain or obtain authorization to access domain resources after they are logged on. Also, problems will occur when Group Policy is applied to client computers if the system time is not synchronized with the Domain Controllers.

	Rationale:
	Users who can change the time on a computer could cause several problems. For example, time stamps on event log entries could be made inaccurate, time stamps on files and folders that are created or modified could be incorrect, and computers that belong to a domain may not be able to authenticate themselves or users who try to log on to the domain from them. Also, because the Kerberos authentication protocol requires that the requestor and authenticator have their clocks synchronized within an administrator-defined skew period, an attacker who changes a computer's time may cause that computer to be unable to obtain or grant Kerberos tickets.
	The risk from these types of events is mitigated on most Domain Controllers, Member Servers, and end-user computers because the Windows Time service automatically synchronizes time with Domain Controllers in the following ways:
	 All client desktop computers and Member Servers use the authenticating Domain Controller as their inbound time partner.
	 All Domain Controllers in a domain nominate the Primary Domain Controller (PDC) Emulator operations master as their inbound time partner.
	 All PDC Emulator operations masters follow the hierarchy of domains in the selection of their inbound time partner.
	 The PDC Emulator operations master at the root of the domain is authoritative for the organization. Therefore it is recommended that you configure this computer to synchronize with a reliable external time server.
	This vulnerability becomes much more serious if an attacker is able to change the system time and then stop the Windows Time service or reconfigure it to synchronize with a time server that is not accurate.

	This policy setting allows a process to create an access token, which may provide elevated rights to access sensitive data.
	The recommended state for this setting is: No One.
	Note: This user right is considered a "sensitive privilege" for the purposes of auditing. Rationale:
	A user account that is given this user right has complete control over the system and can lead to the system being compromised. It is highly recommended that you do not assign any user accounts this right.
	The operating system examines a user's access token to determine the level of the user's privileges. Access tokens are built when users log on to the local computer or connect to a remote computer over a network. When you revoke a privilege, the change is immediately recorded, but the change is not reflected in the user's access token until the next time the user logs on or connects. Users with the ability to create or modify tokens can change the level of access for any currently logged on account. They could escalate their own privileges or create a DoS condition.

2.2.14 (L1) Configure 'Create symbolic links' (Automated)

  description: |
	This policy setting determines which users can create symbolic links. In Windows Vista, existing NTFS file system objects, such as files and folders, can be accessed by referring to a new kind of file system object called a symbolic link. A symbolic link is a pointer (much like a shortcut or .lnk file) to another file system object, which can be a file, folder, shortcut or another symbolic link. The difference between a shortcut and a symbolic link is that a shortcut only works from within the Windows shell. To other programs and applications, shortcuts are just another file, whereas with symbolic links, the concept of a shortcut is implemented as a feature of the NTFS file system.
	Symbolic links can potentially expose security vulnerabilities in applications that are not designed to use them. For this reason, the privilege for creating symbolic links should only be assigned to trusted users. By default, only Administrators can create symbolic links.
	The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators and (when the Hyper-V feature is installed) NT VIRTUAL MACHINE\Virtual Machines.
	Rationale:
	Users who have the Create symbolic links user right could inadvertently or maliciously expose your system to symbolic link attacks. Symbolic link attacks can be used to change the permissions on a file, to corrupt data, to destroy data, or as a Denial of Service attack.

Developers who are debugging their own applications do not need to be assigned this user right; however, developers who are debugging new system components will need it.
	The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators.
	Note: This user right is considered a "sensitive privilege" for the purposes of auditing. Rationale:
	The Debug programs user right can be exploited to capture sensitive computer information from system memory, or to access and modify kernel or application structures. Some attack tools exploit this user right to extract hashed passwords and other private security information, or to insert rootkit code. By default, the Debug programs user right is assigned only to administrators, which helps to mitigate the risk from this vulnerability.

	The policy setting allows programs that run on behalf of a user to impersonate that user (or another specified account) so that they can act on behalf of the user. If this user right is required for this kind of impersonation, an unauthorized user will not be able to convince a client to connect—for example, by remote procedure call (RPC) or named pipes—to a service that they have created to impersonate that client, which could elevate the unauthorized user's permissions to administrative or system levels.

COM servers that are started by the COM infrastructure and configured to run under a specific account also have the Service group added to their access tokens. As a result, these processes are assigned this user right when they are started.
	Also, a user can impersonate an access token if any of the following conditions exist:
	 The access token that is being impersonated is for this user.
	 The user, in this logon session, logged on to the network with explicit credentials
	to create the access token.
	 The requested level is less than Impersonate, such as Anonymous or Identify.
	An attacker with the Impersonate a client after authentication user right could create a service, trick a client to make them connect to the service, and then impersonate that client to elevate the attacker's level of access to that of the client.
	The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators, LOCAL SERVICE, NETWORK SERVICE, SERVICE.
	Note: This user right is considered a "sensitive privilege" for the purposes of auditing.
	Rationale:
	An attacker with the Impersonate a client after authentication user right could create a service, trick a client to make them connect to the service, and then impersonate that client to elevate the attacker's level of access to that of the client.

2.2.29 (L2) Configure 'Log on as a service' (Automated)

  description: |
	This policy setting allows accounts to launch network services or to register a process as a service running on the system. This user right should be restricted on any computer in a high security environment, but because many applications may require this privilege, it should be carefully evaluated and tested before configuring it in an enterprise environment. On Windows Vista-based (and newer) computers, no users or groups have this privilege by default.
	The recommended state for this setting is: No One or (when the Hyper-V feature is installed) NT VIRTUAL MACHINE\Virtual Machines.
	Note: The Hyper-V feature was first introduced on Windows workstations with the 64-bit version of Windows 8.0, so the NT VIRTUAL MACHINE\Virtual Machines option does not apply to Windows 7 (or older) versions of Windows. Older OSes should only be configured for No One.
	Rationale:
	Log on as a service is a powerful user right because it allows accounts to launch network services or services that run continuously on a computer, even when no one is logged on to the console. The risk is reduced by the fact that only users with administrative privileges can install and configure services. An attacker who has already attained that level of access could configure the service to run with the Local System account.

	The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators.
	Note: This user right is considered a "sensitive privilege" for the purposes of auditing. Rationale:
	An attacker with the Restore files and directories user right could restore sensitive data to a computer and overwrite data that is more recent, which could lead to loss of important data, data corruption, or a denial of service. Attackers could overwrite executable files that are used by legitimate administrators or system services with versions that include malicious software to grant themselves elevated privileges, compromise data, or install backdoors for continued access to the computer.
	Note: Even if the following countermeasure is configured, an attacker could still restore data to a computer in a domain that is controlled by the attacker. Therefore, it is critical that organizations carefully protect the media that is used to back up data.

2.3.1.1 (L1) Ensure 'Accounts: Administrator account status' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)

  description: |
	This policy setting enables or disables the Administrator account during normal operation. When a computer is booted into safe mode, the Administrator account is always enabled, regardless of how this setting is configured. Note that this setting will have no impact when applied to the Domain Controllers organizational unit via group policy because Domain Controllers have no local account database. It can be configured at the domain level via group policy, similar to account lockout and password policy settings.
	The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.
	Rationale:
	In some organizations, it can be a daunting management challenge to maintain a regular schedule for periodic password changes for local accounts. Therefore, you may want to disable the built-in Administrator account instead of relying on regular password changes to protect it from attack. Another reason to disable this built-in account is that it cannot be locked out no matter how many failed logons it accrues, which makes it a prime target for brute force attacks that attempt to guess passwords. Also, this account has a well-known security identifier (SID) and there are third-party tools that allow authentication by using the SID rather than the account name. This capability means that even if you rename the Administrator account, an attacker could launch a brute force attack by using the SID to log on.

2.3.1.2 (L1) Ensure 'Accounts: Block Microsoft accounts' is set to 'Users can't add or log on with Microsoft accounts' (Automated)

  description: |
	This policy setting prevents users from adding new Microsoft accounts on this computer.
	The recommended state for this setting is: Users can't add or log on with Microsoft accounts.
	Rationale:
	Organizations that want to effectively implement identity management policies and maintain firm control of what accounts are used to log onto their computers will probably want to block Microsoft accounts. Organizations may also need to block Microsoft accounts in order to meet the requirements of compliance standards that apply to their information systems.

2.3.1.3 (L1) Ensure 'Accounts: Guest account status' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)

  description: |
	This policy setting determines whether the Guest account is enabled or disabled. The Guest account allows unauthenticated network users to gain access to the system.
	The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.
	Note: This setting will have no impact when applied to the Domain Controllers organizational unit via group policy because Domain Controllers have no local account database. It can be configured at the domain level via group policy, similar to account lockout and password policy settings.
	Rationale:
	The default Guest account allows unauthenticated network users to log on as Guest with no password. These unauthorized users could access any resources that are accessible to the Guest account over the network. This capability means that any network shares with permissions that allow access to the Guest account, the Guests group, or the Everyone group will be accessible over the network, which could lead to the exposure or corruption of data.

2.3.1.4 (L1) Ensure 'Accounts: Limit local account use of blank passwords to console logon only' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

  description: |
	This policy setting determines whether local accounts that are not password protected can be used to log on from locations other than the physical computer console. If you enable this policy setting, local accounts that have blank passwords will not be able to log on to the network from remote client computers. Such accounts will only be able to log on at the keyboard of the computer.
	The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.
	Rationale:
	Blank passwords are a serious threat to computer security and should be forbidden through both organizational policy and suitable technical measures. In fact, the default settings for Active Directory domains require complex passwords of at least seven characters. However, if users with the ability to create new accounts bypass your domain-based password policies, they could create accounts with blank passwords. For example, a user could build a stand-alone computer, create one or more accounts with blank passwords, and then join the computer to the domain. The local accounts with blank passwords would still function. Anyone who knows the name of one of these unprotected accounts could then use it to log on.

2.3.1.5 (L1) Configure 'Accounts: Rename administrator account' (Automated)

  description: |
	The built-in local administrator account is a well-known account name that attackers will target. It is recommended to choose another name for this account, and to avoid names that denote administrative or elevated access accounts. Be sure to also change the default description for the local administrator (through the Computer Management console).
	Rationale:
	The Administrator account exists on all computers that run the Windows 2000 or newer operating systems. If you rename this account, it is slightly more difficult for unauthorized persons to guess this privileged user name and password combination.
	The built-in Administrator account cannot be locked out, regardless of how many times an attacker might use a bad password. This capability makes the Administrator account a popular target for brute force attacks that attempt to guess passwords. The value of this countermeasure is lessened because this account has a well-known SID, and there are third-party tools that allow authentication by using the SID rather than the account name. Therefore, even if you rename the Administrator account, an attacker could launch a brute force attack by using the SID to log on.

  description: |
	This policy setting allows administrators to enable the more precise auditing capabilities present in Windows Vista.
	The Audit Policy settings available in Windows Server 2003 Active Directory do not yet contain settings for managing the new auditing subcategories. To properly apply the auditing policies prescribed in this baseline, the Audit: Force audit policy subcategory settings (Windows Vista or later) to override audit policy category settings setting needs to be configured to Enabled.
	The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.
	Important: Be very cautious about audit settings that can generate a large volume of traffic. For example, if you enable either success or failure auditing for all of the Privilege Use subcategories, the high volume of audit events generated can make it difficult to find other types of entries in the Security log. Such a configuration could also have a significant impact on system performance.
	Rationale:
	Prior to the introduction of auditing subcategories in Windows Vista, it was difficult to track events at a per-system or per-user level. The larger event categories created too many events and the key information that needed to be audited was difficult to find.

2.3.2.2 (L1) Ensure 'Audit: Shut down system immediately if unable to log security audits' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)

  description: |
	This policy setting determines whether the system shuts down if it is unable to log Security events. It is a requirement for Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC)-C2 and Common Criteria certification to prevent auditable events from occurring if the audit system is unable to log them. Microsoft has chosen to meet this requirement by halting the system and displaying a stop message if the auditing system experiences a failure. When this policy setting is enabled, the system will be shut down if a security audit cannot be logged for any reason.
	If the Audit: Shut down system immediately if unable to log security audits setting is enabled, unplanned system failures can occur. The administrative burden can be significant, especially if you also configure the Retention method for the Security log to Do not overwrite events (clear log manually). This configuration causes a repudiation threat (a backup operator could deny that they backed up or restored data) to become a denial of service (DoS) vulnerability, because a server could be forced to shut down if it is overwhelmed with logon events and other security events that are written to the Security log. Also, because the shutdown is not graceful, it is possible that irreparable damage to the operating system, applications, or data could result. Although the NTFS file system guarantees its integrity when an ungraceful computer shutdown occurs, it cannot guarantee that every data file for every application will still be in a usable form when the computer restarts.
	The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.
	Rationale:
	If the computer is unable to record events to the Security log, critical evidence or important troubleshooting information may not be available for review after a security incident. Also, an attacker could potentially generate a large volume of Security log events to purposely force a computer shutdown.

	It may be appropriate in some organizations to allow users to install printer drivers on their own workstations. However, in a high security environment, you should allow only Administrators, not users, to do this, because printer driver installation may unintentionally cause the computer to become less stable. A malicious user could install inappropriate printer drivers in a deliberate attempt to damage the computer, or a user might accidentally install malicious software that masquerades as a printer driver. It is feasible for an attacker to disguise a Trojan horse program as a printer driver. The program may appear to users as if they must use it to print, but such a program could unleash malicious code on your computer network.

2.3.8.1 (L1) Ensure 'Microsoft network client: Digitally sign communications (always)' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

  description: |
	This policy setting determines whether packet signing is required by the SMB client component.
	Note: When Windows Vista-based computers have this policy setting enabled and they connect to file or print shares on remote servers, it is important that the setting is synchronized with its companion setting, Microsoft network server: Digitally sign communications (always), on those servers. For more information about these settings, see the "Microsoft network client and server: Digitally sign communications (four related settings)" section in Chapter 5 of the Threats and Countermeasures guide.
	The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.
	Rationale:
	Session hijacking uses tools that allow attackers who have access to the same network as the client or server to interrupt, end, or steal a session in progress. Attackers can potentially intercept and modify unsigned SMB packets and then modify the traffic and forward it so that the server might perform undesirable actions. Alternatively, the attacker could pose as the server or client after legitimate authentication and gain unauthorized access to data.
	SMB is the resource sharing protocol that is supported by many Windows operating systems. It is the basis of NetBIOS and many other protocols. SMB signatures authenticate both users and the servers that host the data. If either side fails the authentication process, data transmission will not take place.

	This policy setting allows you to specify the amount of continuous idle time that must pass in an SMB session before the session is suspended because of inactivity. Administrators can use this policy setting to control when a computer suspends an inactive SMB session. If client activity resumes, the session is automatically reestablished.

2.3.10.3 (L1) Ensure 'Network access: Do not allow anonymous enumeration of SAM accounts and shares' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

  description: |
	This policy setting controls the ability of anonymous users to enumerate SAM accounts as well as shares. If you enable this policy setting, anonymous users will not be able to enumerate domain account user names and network share names on the systems in your environment.
	The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled. Note: This policy has no effect on Domain Controllers. Rationale:
	An unauthorized user could anonymously list account names and shared resources and use the information to attempt to guess passwords or perform social engineering attacks. (Social engineering attacks try to deceive users in some way to obtain passwords or some form of security information.)

  description: |
	This policy setting determines how network logons that use local accounts are authenticated. The Classic option allows precise control over access to resources, including the ability to assign different types of access to different users for the same resource. The Guest only option allows you to treat all users equally. In this context, all users authenticate as Guest only to receive the same access level to a given resource.
	The recommended state for this setting is: Classic - local users authenticate as themselves.
	Note: This setting does not affect interactive logons that are performed remotely by using such services as Telnet or Remote Desktop Services (formerly called Terminal Services).
	Rationale:
	With the Guest only model, any user who can authenticate to your computer over the network does so with guest privileges, which probably means that they will not have write access to shared resources on that computer. Although this restriction does increase security, it makes it more difficult for authorized users to access shared resources on those computers because ACLs on those resources must include access control entries (ACEs) for the Guest account. With the Classic model, local accounts should be password protected. Otherwise, if Guest access is enabled, anyone can use those user accounts to access shared system resources.

	This policy setting determines whether Local System services that use Negotiate when reverting to NTLM authentication can use the computer identity. This policy is supported on at least Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 R2.
	The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.
	Rationale:
	When connecting to computers running versions of Windows earlier than Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008 (non-R2), services running as Local System and using SPNEGO (Negotiate) that revert to NTLM use the computer identity. In Windows 7, if you are connecting to a computer running Windows Server 2008 or Windows Vista, then a system service uses either the computer identity or a NULL session. When connecting with a NULL session, a system-generated session key is created, which provides no protection but allows applications to sign and encrypt data without errors. When connecting with the computer identity, both signing and encryption is supported in order to provide data protection.

2.3.11.3 (L1) Ensure 'Network Security: Allow PKU2U authentication requests to this computer to use online identities' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)

  description: |
	This setting determines if online identities are able to authenticate to this computer.
	The Public Key Cryptography Based User-to-User (PKU2U) protocol introduced in Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 is implemented as a security support provider (SSP). The SSP enables peer-to-peer authentication, particularly through the Windows 7 media and file sharing feature called HomeGroup, which permits sharing between computers that are not members of a domain.
	With PKU2U, a new extension was introduced to the Negotiate authentication package, Spnego.dll. In previous versions of Windows, Negotiate decided whether to use Kerberos or NTLM for authentication. The extension SSP for Negotiate, Negoexts.dll, which is treated as an authentication protocol by Windows, supports Microsoft SSPs including PKU2U.
	When computers are configured to accept authentication requests by using online IDs, Negoexts.dll calls the PKU2U SSP on the computer that is used to log on. The PKU2U SSP obtains a local certificate and exchanges the policy between the peer computers. When validated on the peer computer, the certificate within the metadata is sent to the logon peer for validation and associates the user's certificate to a security token and the logon process completes.
	The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.
	Rationale:
	The PKU2U protocol is a peer-to-peer authentication protocol - authentication should be managed centrally in most managed networks.

  description: |
	This policy setting determines whether the LAN Manager (LM) hash value for the new password is stored when the password is changed. The LM hash is relatively weak and prone to attack compared to the cryptographically stronger Microsoft Windows NT hash. Since LM hashes are stored on the local computer in the security database, passwords can then be easily compromised if the database is attacked.
	Note: Older operating systems and some third-party applications may fail when this policy setting is enabled. Also, note that the password will need to be changed on all accounts after you enable this setting to gain the proper benefit.
	The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.
	Rationale:
	The SAM file can be targeted by attackers who seek access to username and password hashes. Such attacks use special tools to crack passwords, which can then be used to impersonate users and gain access to resources on your network. These types of attacks will not be prevented if you enable this policy setting, but it will be much more difficult for these types of attacks to succeed.

2.3.11.7 (L1) Ensure 'Network security: LAN Manager authentication level' is set to 'Send NTLMv2 response only. Refuse LM & NTLM' (Automated)

  description: |
	LAN Manager (LM) was a family of early Microsoft client/server software (predating Windows NT) that allowed users to link personal computers together on a single network. LM network capabilities included transparent file and print sharing, user security features, and network administration tools. In Active Directory domains, the Kerberos protocol is the default authentication protocol. However, if the Kerberos protocol is not negotiated for some reason, Active Directory will use LM, NTLM, or NTLMv2. LAN Manager authentication includes the LM, NTLM, and NTLM version 2 (NTLMv2) variants, and is the protocol that is used to authenticate all Windows clients when they perform the following operations:
	 Join a domain
	 Authenticate between Active Directory forests
	 Authenticate to down-level domains
	 Authenticate to computers that do not run Windows 2000, Windows Server 2003,
	or Windows XP
	 Authenticate to computers that are not in the domain
	The Network security: LAN Manager authentication level setting determines which challenge/response authentication protocol is used for network logons. This choice affects the level of authentication protocol used by clients, the level of session security negotiated, and the level of authentication accepted by servers.
	The recommended state for this setting is: Send NTLMv2 response only. Refuse LM & NTLM.

	Rationale:
	Windows 2000 and Windows XP clients were configured by default to send LM and NTLM authentication responses (Windows 95-based and Windows 98-based clients only send LM). The default settings in OSes predating Windows Vista / Windows Server 2008 (non-R2) allowed all clients to authenticate with servers and use their resources. However, this meant that LM responses - the weakest form of authentication response - were sent over the network, and it was potentially possible for attackers to sniff that traffic to more easily reproduce the user's password.
	The Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT operating systems cannot use the Kerberos version 5 protocol for authentication. For this reason, in a Windows Server 2003 domain, these computers authenticate by default with both the LM and NTLM protocols for network authentication. You can enforce a more secure authentication protocol for Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT by using NTLMv2. For the logon process, NTLMv2 uses a secure channel to protect the authentication process. Even if you use NTLMv2 for older clients and servers, Windows-based clients and servers that are members of the domain will use the Kerberos authentication protocol to authenticate with Windows Server 2003 or newer Domain Controllers. For these reasons, it is strongly preferred to restrict the use of LM & NTLM (non-v2) as much as possible.

  description: |
	This policy setting determines the level of data signing that is requested on behalf of clients that issue LDAP BIND requests.
	Note: This policy setting does not have any impact on LDAP simple bind (ldap_simple_bind) or LDAP simple bind through SSL (ldap_simple_bind_s). No Microsoft LDAP clients that are included with Windows XP Professional use ldap_simple_bind or ldap_simple_bind_s to communicate with a Domain Controller.
	The recommended state for this setting is: Negotiate signing. Configuring this setting to Require signing also conforms to the benchmark.
	Rationale:
	Unsigned network traffic is susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks in which an intruder captures the packets between the client and server, modifies them, and then forwards them to the server. For an LDAP server, this susceptibility means that an attacker could cause a server to make decisions that are based on false or altered data from the LDAP queries. To lower this risk in your network, you can implement strong physical security measures to protect the network infrastructure. Also, you can make all types of man-in- the-middle attacks extremely difficult if you require digital signatures on all network packets by means of IPsec authentication headers.

  description: |
	This policy setting determines whether case insensitivity is enforced for all subsystems. The Microsoft Win32 subsystem is case insensitive. However, the kernel supports case sensitivity for other subsystems, such as the Portable Operating System Interface for UNIX (POSIX). Because Windows is case insensitive (but the POSIX subsystem will support case sensitivity), failure to enforce this policy setting makes it possible for a user of the POSIX subsystem to create a file with the same name as another file by using mixed case to label it. Such a situation can block access to these files by another user who uses typical Win32 tools, because only one of the files will be available.
	The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.
	Rationale:
	Because Windows is case-insensitive but the POSIX subsystem will support case sensitivity, failure to enable this policy setting would make it possible for a user of that subsystem to create a file with the same name as another file but with a different mix of upper and lower case letters. Such a situation could potentially confuse users when they try to access such files from normal Win32 tools because only one of the files will be available.

An attack vector for these programs was to discover the password of the account named "Administrator" because that user account was created for all installations of Windows. To address this risk, in Windows Vista and newer, the built-in Administrator account is now disabled by default. In a default installation of a new computer, accounts with administrative control over the computer are initially set up in one of two ways:
	 If the computer is not joined to a domain, the first user account you create has the equivalent permissions as a local administrator.
	 If the computer is joined to a domain, no local administrator accounts are created. The Enterprise or Domain Administrator must log on to the computer and create one if a local administrator account is warranted.
	Once Windows is installed, the built-in Administrator account may be manually enabled, but we strongly recommend that this account remain disabled.

2.3.17.5 (L1) Ensure 'User Account Control: Only elevate UIAccess applications that are installed in secure locations' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

  description: |
	This policy setting controls whether applications that request to run with a User Interface Accessibility (UIAccess) integrity level must reside in a secure location in the file system. Secure locations are limited to the following:
	 ...\Program Files\, including subfolders
	 ...\Windows\System32\
	 ...\Program Files (x86)\, including subfolders (for 64-bit versions of Windows)
	Note: Windows enforces a public key infrastructure (PKI) signature check on any interactive application that requests to run with a UIAccess integrity level regardless of the state of this security setting.
	The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.
	Rationale:
	UIAccess Integrity allows an application to bypass User Interface Privilege Isolation (UIPI) restrictions when an application is elevated in privilege from a standard user to an administrator. This is required to support accessibility features such as screen readers that are transmitting user interfaces to alternative forms. A process that is started with UIAccess rights has the following abilities:
	 To set the foreground window.
	 To drive any application window using SendInput function.
	 To use read input for all integrity levels using low-level hooks, raw input,
	GetKeyState, GetAsyncKeyState, and GetKeyboardInput.
	 T o set journal hooks.
	 To uses AttachThreadInput to attach a thread to a higher integrity input queue.

	The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled or Not Installed.
	Note: In Windows 8.1 and Windows 10, this service is bundled with the SMB 1.0/CIFS File Sharing Support optional feature. As a result, removing that feature (highly recommended unless backward compatibility is needed to XP/2003 and older Windows OSes - see Stop using SMB1 | Storage at Microsoft) will also remediate this recommendation. The feature is not installed by default starting with Windows 10 R1709.
	Rationale:
	This is a legacy service - its sole purpose is to maintain a list of computers and their network shares in the environment (i.e. "Network Neighborhood"). If enabled, it generates a lot of unnecessary traffic, including "elections" to see who gets to be the "master browser". This noisy traffic could also aid malicious attackers in discovering online machines, because the service also allows anyone to "browse" for shared resources without any authentication. This service used to be running by default in older Windows versions (e.g. Windows XP), but today it only remains for backward compatibility for very old software that requires it.

	Detects other Infrared devices that are in range and launches the file transfer application.
	The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled or Not Installed.
	Rationale:
	Infrared connections can potentially be a source of data compromise - especially via the automatic "file transfer application" functionality. Enterprise-managed systems should utilize a more secure method of connection than infrared.

  description: |
	Provides network access translation, addressing, name resolution and/or intrusion prevention services for a home or small office network.

	Rationale:
	Internet Connection Sharing (ICS) is a feature that allows someone to "share" their Internet connection with other machines on the network - it was designed for home or small office environments where only one machine has Internet access - it effectively turns that machine into an Internet router. This feature causes the bridging of networks and likely bypassing other, more secure pathways. It should not be used on any enterprise-managed system.

While this can certainly have some functionality and performance benefits for running those applications, it also creates new security risks in the event that a hacker injects malicious code into a Linux application. For best security, it is preferred to run Linux applications on Linux, and Windows applications on Windows.

Rationale:
This service is critically necessary in order to directly attach to an iSCSI device. However, iSCSI itself uses a very weak authentication protocol (CHAP), which means that the passwords for iSCSI communication are easily exposed, unless all of the traffic is isolated and/or encrypted using another technology like IPsec. This service is generally more appropriate for servers in a controlled environment then on workstations requiring high security.

  description: |
	Creates a connection to a remote network whenever a program references a remote DNS or NetBIOS name or address.
	The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.
	Rationale:
	The function of this service is to provide a "demand dial" type of functionality. In a high security environment, it is preferred that any remote "dial" connections (whether they be legacy dial-in POTS or VPN) are initiated by the user, not automatically by the system.

	Allows errors to be reported when programs stop working or responding and allows existing solutions to be delivered. Also allows logs to be generated for diagnostic and repair services.
	The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.
	Rationale:
	If a Windows Error occurs in a secure, enterprise managed environment, the error should be reported directly to IT staff for troubleshooting and remediation. There is no benefit to the corporation to report these errors directly to Microsoft, and there is some risk of unknowingly exposing sensitive data as part of the error.

	Provides Web connectivity and administration through the Internet Information Services Manager.
	The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled or Not Installed.
	Note: This service is not installed by default. It is supplied with Windows, but is installed by enabling an optional Windows feature (Internet Information Services - World Wide Web Services).
	Note #2: An organization may choose to selectively grant exceptions to web developers to allow IIS (or another web server) on their workstation, in order for them to locally test & develop web pages. However, the organization should track those machines and ensure the security controls and mitigations are kept up to date, to reduce risk of compromise.
	Rationale:
	Hosting a website from a workstation is an increased security risk, as the attack surface of that workstation is then greatly increased. If proper security mitigations are not followed, the chance of successful attack increases significantly.
	Note: This security concern applies to any web server application installed on a workstation, not just IIS.

9.2.3 (L1) Ensure 'Windows Firewall: Private: Outbound connections' is set to 'Allow (default)' (Automated)

  description: |
	This setting determines the behavior for outbound connections that do not match an outbound firewall rule.
	The recommended state for this setting is: Allow (default).
	Note: If you set Outbound connections to Block and then deploy the firewall policy by using a GPO, computers that receive the GPO settings cannot receive subsequent Group Policy updates unless you create and deploy an outbound rule that enables Group Policy to work. Predefined rules for Core Networking include outbound rules that enable Group Policy to work. Ensure that these outbound rules are active, and thoroughly test firewall profiles before deploying.
	Rationale:
	Some people believe that it is prudent to block all outbound connections except those specifically approved by the user or administrator. Microsoft disagrees with this opinion, blocking outbound connections by default will force users to deal with a large number of dialog boxes prompting them to authorize or block applications such as their web browser or instant messaging software. Additionally, blocking outbound traffic has little value because if an attacker has compromised the system they can reconfigure the firewall anyway.

  description: |
	This subcategory reports the results of validation tests on credentials submitted for a user account logon request. These events occur on the computer that is authoritative for the credentials. For domain accounts, the Domain Controller is authoritative, whereas for local accounts, the local computer is authoritative. In domain environments, most of the Account Logon events occur in the Security log of the Domain Controllers that are authoritative for the domain accounts. However, these events can occur on other computers in the organization when local accounts are used to log on. Events for this subcategory include:
	 4774: An account was mapped for logon.
	 4775: An account could not be mapped for logon.
	 4776: The Domain Controller attempted to validate the credentials for an
	account.
	 4777: The Domain Controller failed to validate the credentials for an account.
	The recommended state for this setting is: Success and Failure. Rationale:
	Auditing these events may be useful when investigating a security incident. Impact:
	If no audit settings are configured, or if audit settings are too lax on the computers in your organization, security incidents might not be detected or not enough evidence will be available for network forensic analysis after security incidents occur. However, if audit settings are too severe, critically important entries in the Security log may be obscured by all of the meaningless entries and computer performance and the available amount of data storage may be seriously affected. Companies that operate in certain regulated industries may have legal obligations to log certain events or activities.

17.7.2 (L1) Ensure 'Audit Authentication Policy Change' is set to include 'Success' (Automated)

  description: |
	This subcategory reports changes in authentication policy. Events for this subcategory include:
	 4706: A new trust was created to a domain.
	 4707: A trust to a domain was removed.
	 4713: Kerberos policy was changed.
	 4716: Trusted domain information was modified.
	 4717: System security access was granted to an account.
	 4718: System security access was removed from an account.
	 4739: Domain Policy was changed.
	 4864: A namespace collision was detected.
	 4865: A trusted forest information entry was added.
	 4866: A trusted forest information entry was removed.
	 4867: A trusted forest information entry was modified.
	The recommended state for this setting is to include: Success.
	Rationale:
	Auditing these events may be useful when investigating a security incident. Impact:
	If no audit settings are configured, or if audit settings are too lax on the computers in your organization, security incidents might not be detected or not enough evidence will be available for network forensic analysis after security incidents occur. However, if audit settings are too severe, critically important entries in the Security log may be obscured by all of the meaningless entries and computer performance and the available amount of data storage may be seriously affected. Companies that operate in certain regulated industries may have legal obligations to log certain events or activities.

17.9.1 (L1) Ensure 'Audit IPsec Driver' is set to 'Success and Failure' (Automated)

  description: |
	This subcategory reports on the activities of the Internet Protocol security (IPsec) driver. Events for this subcategory include:
	 4960: IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed an integrity check. If this problem persists, it could indicate a network issue or that packets are being modified in transit to this computer. Verify that the packets sent from the remote computer are the same as those received by this computer. This error might also indicate interoperability problems with other IPsec implementations.
	 4961: IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed a replay check. If this problem persists, it could indicate a replay attack against this computer.
	 4962: IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed a replay check. The inbound packet had too low a sequence number to ensure it was not a replay.
	 4963: IPsec dropped an inbound clear text packet that should have been secured. This is usually due to the remote computer changing its IPsec policy without informing this computer. This could also be a spoofing attack attempt.
	 4965: IPsec received a packet from a remote computer with an incorrect Security Parameter Index (SPI). This is usually caused by malfunctioning hardware that is corrupting packets. If these errors persist, verify that the packets sent from the remote computer are the same as those received by this computer. This error may also indicate interoperability problems with other IPsec implementations. In that case, if connectivity is not impeded, then these events can be ignored.
	 5478: IPsec Services has started successfully.
	 5479: IPsec Services has been shut down successfully. The shutdown of IPsec
	Services can put the computer at greater risk of network attack or expose the
	computer to potential security risks.
	 5480: IPsec Services failed to get the complete list of network interfaces on the
	computer. This poses a potential security risk because some of the network interfaces may not get the protection provided by the applied IPsec filters. Use the IP Security Monitor snap-in to diagnose the problem.
	 5483: IPsec Services failed to initialize RPC server. IPsec Services could not be started.
	 5484: IPsec Services has experienced a critical failure and has been shut down. The shutdown of IPsec Services can put the computer at greater risk of network attack or expose the computer to potential security risks.

	 5485: IPsec Services failed to process some IPsec filters on a plug-and-play event for network interfaces. This poses a potential security risk because some of the network interfaces may not get the protection provided by the applied IPsec filters. Use the IP Security Monitor snap-in to diagnose the problem.
	The recommended state for this setting is: Success and Failure. Rationale:
	Auditing these events may be useful when investigating a security incident. Impact:
	If no audit settings are configured, or if audit settings are too lax on the computers in your organization, security incidents might not be detected or not enough evidence will be available for network forensic analysis after security incidents occur.

  description: |
	This setting determines which method NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NetBT) uses to register and resolve names. The available methods are:
	 The B-node (broadcast) method only uses broadcasts.
	 The P-node (point-to-point) method only uses name queries to a name server
	(WINS).
	 The M-node (mixed) method broadcasts first, then queries a name server (WINS)
	if broadcast failed.
	 The H-node (hybrid) method queries a name server (WINS) first, then broadcasts
	if the query failed.
	The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: P-node (recommended) (point-to- point).
	Note: Resolution through LMHOSTS or DNS follows these methods. If the NodeType registry value is present, it overrides any DhcpNodeType registry value. If neither NodeType nor DhcpNodeType is present, the computer uses B-node (broadcast) if there are no WINS servers configured for the network, or H-node (hybrid) if there is at least one WINS server configured.
	Rationale:
	In order to help mitigate the risk of NetBIOS Name Service (NBT-NS) poisoning attacks, setting the node type to P-node (point-to-point) will prevent the system from sending out NetBIOS broadcasts.

18.4.7 (L1) Ensure 'MSS: (NoNameReleaseOnDemand) Allow the computer to ignore NetBIOS name release requests except from WINS servers' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

  description: |
	NetBIOS over TCP/IP is a network protocol that among other things provides a way to easily resolve NetBIOS names that are registered on Windows-based systems to the IP addresses that are configured on those systems. This setting determines whether the computer releases its NetBIOS name when it receives a name-release request.
	The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.
	Rationale:
	The NetBT protocol is designed not to use authentication, and is therefore vulnerable to spoofing. Spoofing makes a transmission appear to come from a user other than the user who performed the action. A malicious user could exploit the unauthenticated nature of the protocol to send a name-conflict datagram to a target computer, which would cause the computer to relinquish its name and not respond to queries.
	An attacker could send a request over the network and query a computer to release its NetBIOS name. As with any change that could affect applications, it is recommended that you test this change in a non-production environment before you change the production environment.
	The result of such an attack could be to cause intermittent connectivity issues on the target computer, or even to prevent the use of Network Neighborhood, domain logons, the NET SEND command, or additional NetBIOS name resolution.

18.4.13 (L1) Ensure 'MSS: (WarningLevel) Percentage threshold for the security event log at which the system will generate a warning' is set to 'Enabled: 90% or less' (Automated)

  description: |
	This setting can generate a security audit in the Security event log when the log reaches a user-defined threshold.
	The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: 90% or less.
	Note: If log settings are configured to Overwrite events as needed or Overwrite events
	older than x days, this event will not be generated.
	Rationale:
	If the Security log reaches 90 percent of its capacity and the computer has not been configured to overwrite events as needed, more recent events will not be written to the log. If the log reaches its capacity and the computer has been configured to shut down when it can no longer record events to the Security log, the computer will shut down and will no longer be available to provide network services.

  description: |
	This setting determines if DNS over HTTPS (DoH) is used by the system. DNS over HTTPS (DoH) is a protocol for performing remote Domain Name System (DNS) resolution over the Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS). For additional information on DNS over HTTPS (DoH), visit: Secure DNS Client over HTTPS (DoH) on Windows Server 2022 | Microsoft Docs.
	The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Allow DoH. Configuring this setting to Enabled: Require DoH also conforms to the benchmark.
	Rationale:
	DNS over HTTPS (DoH) helps protect against DNS spoofing. Spoofing makes a transmission appear to come from a user other than the user who performed the action. It can also help prevent man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks because the session in- between is encrypted.

18.5.4.2 (L1) Ensure 'Turn off multicast name resolution' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

  description: |
	LLMNR is a secondary name resolution protocol. With LLMNR, queries are sent using multicast over a local network link on a single subnet from a client computer to another client computer on the same subnet that also has LLMNR enabled. LLMNR does not require a DNS server or DNS client configuration, and provides name resolution in scenarios in which conventional DNS name resolution is not possible.
	The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.
	Rationale:
	An attacker can listen on a network for these LLMNR (UDP/5355) or NBT-NS (UDP/137) broadcasts and respond to them, tricking the host into thinking that it knows the location of the requested system.
	Note: To completely mitigate local name resolution poisoning, in addition to this setting, the properties of each installed NIC should also be set to Disable NetBIOS over TCP/IP (on the WINS tab in the NIC properties). Unfortunately, there is no global setting to achieve this that automatically applies to all NICs - it is a per-NIC setting that varies with different NIC hardware installations.

18.5.14.1 (L1) Ensure 'Hardened UNC Paths' is set to 'Enabled, with "Require Mutual Authentication" and "Require Integrity" set for all NETLOGON and SYSVOL shares' (Automated)

  description: |
	This policy setting configures secure access to UNC paths.
	The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled, with "Require Mutual Authentication" and "Require Integrity" set for all NETLOGON and SYSVOL
	shares.
	Note: If the environment exclusively contains Windows 8.0 / Server 2012 (non-R2) or newer systems, then the "Privacy" setting may (optionally) also be set to enable SMB encryption. However, using SMB encryption will render the targeted share paths completely inaccessible by older OSes, so only use this additional option with caution and thorough testing.
	Rationale:
	In February 2015, Microsoft released a new control mechanism to mitigate a security risk in Group Policy as part of the MS15-011 / MSKB 3000483 security update. This mechanism requires both the installation of the new security update and also the deployment of specific group policy settings to all computers on the domain from Windows Vista / Server 2008 (non-R2) or newer (the associated security patch to enable this feature was not released for Server 2003). A new group policy template (NetworkProvider.admx/adml) was also provided with the security update.
	Once the new GPO template is in place, the following are the minimum requirements to remediate the Group Policy security risk:
	\\*\NETLOGON RequireMutualAuthentication=1, RequireIntegrity=1 \\*\SYSVOL RequireMutualAuthentication=1, RequireIntegrity=1
	Note: A reboot may be required after the setting is applied to a client machine to access the above paths.
	Additional guidance on the deployment of this security setting is available from the Microsoft Premier Field Engineering (PFE) Platforms TechNet Blog here: Guidance on Deployment of MS15-011 and MS15-014.

Remediation:
To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to Enabled with the following paths configured, at a minimum: \\*\NETLOGON RequireMutualAuthentication=1, RequireIntegrity=1 \\*\SYSVOL RequireMutualAuthentication=1, RequireIntegrity=1

                     Potential value to compare:  --------------------->   'Enabled with the following paths configured, at a minimum'

18.5.19.2.1 (L2) Disable IPv6 (Ensure TCPIP6 Parameter 'DisabledComponents' is set to '0xff (255)') (Automated)

  description: |
	Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) is a set of protocols that computers use to exchange information over the Internet and over home and business networks. IPv6 allows for many more IP addresses to be assigned than IPv4 did. Older networking, hosts and operating systems may not support IPv6 natively.
	The recommended state for this setting is: DisabledComponents - 0xff (255)
	Rationale:
	Since the vast majority of private enterprise managed networks have no need to utilize IPv6 (because they have access to private IPv4 addressing), disabling IPv6 components removes a possible attack surface that is also harder to monitor the traffic on. As a result, we recommend configuring IPv6 to a Disabled state when it is not needed.
  query: |  <LOOK FOR POTENTIAL QURIES IN THE NEXT FEW LINES. THIS IS A SCRIPT BASED EFFORT SO GO TO THE DOC FOR ANY DOUBTS.>     
Navigate to the Registry path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as prescribed.

Remediation:
To establish the recommended configuration, set the following Registry value to 0xff (255) (DWORD):
Note: This change does not take effect until the computer has been restarted.
Note #2: Although Microsoft does not provide an ADMX template to configure this registry value, a custom .ADM template (Disable-IPv6-Components-KB929852.adm) is provided in the CIS Benchmark Remediation Kit to facilitate its configuration. Be aware though that simply turning off the group policy setting in the .ADM template will not "undo" the change once applied. Instead, the opposite setting must be applied to change the registry value to the opposite state.
       

    SELECT 1 FROM registry WHERE (path = 'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\TCPIP6\Parameters\Disabl edComponents' AND data = "XXXXXXXXXX");
 Default Value:
All IPv6 components are enabled and Windows prefers IPv6 over IPv4.

18.8.4.2 (L1) Ensure 'Remote host allows delegation of non- exportable credentials' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

  description: |
	Remote host allows delegation of non-exportable credentials. When using credential delegation, devices provide an exportable version of credentials to the remote host. This exposes users to the risk of credential theft from attackers on the remote host. The Restricted Admin Mode and Windows Defender Remote Credential Guard features are two options to help protect against this risk.
	The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.
	Note: More detailed information on Windows Defender Remote Credential Guard and how it compares to Restricted Admin Mode can be found at this link: Protect Remote Desktop credentials with Windows Defender Remote Credential Guard (Windows 10) | Microsoft Docs
	Rationale:
	Restricted Admin Mode was designed to help protect administrator accounts by ensuring that reusable credentials are not stored in memory on remote devices that could potentially be compromised. Windows Defender Remote Credential Guard helps you protect your credentials over a Remote Desktop connection by redirecting Kerberos requests back to the device that is requesting the connection. Both features should be enabled and supported, as they reduce the chance of credential theft.

18.8.5.1 (NG) Ensure 'Turn On Virtualization Based Security' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

 Next Generation Windows Security (NG) - optional add-on for use in the newest hardware and configuration environments
  description: |
	This policy setting specifies whether Virtualization Based Security is enabled. Virtualization Based Security uses the Windows Hypervisor to provide support for security services.
	The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.
	Note: Virtualization Based Security requires a 64-bit version of Windows with Secure Boot enabled, which in turn requires that Windows was installed with a UEFI BIOS configuration, not a Legacy BIOS configuration. In addition, if running Windows on a virtual machine, the hardware-assisted CPU virtualization feature (Intel VT-x or AMD-V) must be exposed by the host to the guest VM.
	More information on system requirements for this feature can be found at Windows Defender Credential Guard Requirements (Windows 10) | Microsoft Docs
	Note #2: Credential Guard and Device Guard are not currently supported when using Azure IaaS VMs.
	Rationale:
	Kerberos, NTLM, and Credential manager isolate secrets by using virtualization-based security. Previous versions of Windows stored secrets in the Local Security Authority (LSA). Prior to Windows 10, the LSA stored secrets used by the operating system in its process memory. With Windows Defender Credential Guard enabled, the LSA process in the operating system talks to a new component called the isolated LSA process that stores and protects those secrets. Data stored by the isolated LSA process is protected using virtualization-based security and is not accessible to the rest of the operating system.

18.8.7.1 Device Installation Restrictions
This section contains recommendations related to device installation restrictions.
This Group Policy section is provided by the Group Policy template DeviceInstallation.admx/adml that is included with all versions of the Microsoft Windows Administrative Templates.

18.8.7.1.1 (BL) Ensure 'Prevent installation of devices that match any of these device IDs' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

 BitLocker (BL) - optional add-on for when BitLocker is deployed Description:
This policy setting allows you to specify a list of Plug and Play hardware IDs and compatible IDs for devices that Windows is prevented from installing. This policy setting takes precedence over any other policy setting that allows Windows to install a device.
If you enable this policy setting, Windows is prevented from installing a device whose hardware ID or compatible ID appears in the list you create. If you enable this policy setting on a remote desktop server, the policy setting affects redirection of the specified devices from a remote desktop client to the remote desktop server.
If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, devices can be installed and updated as allowed or prevented by other policy settings.
The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.
Note: In versions of Windows 10 Release 1803 (and newer), there is a new control named Enumeration policy for external devices incompatible with Kernel DMA Protection available that mitigates much of the risk for malicious devices that may perform Direct Memory Access (DMA) attacks. The newer control is also now part of the Windows 10 CIS benchmark, in section 18.8.26. However, if your environment still contains any Windows 10 Release 1709 (or older) workstations, then the newer control will not work, so this setting remains important to disable Thunderbolt devices on those systems.
Rationale:
A BitLocker-protected computer may be vulnerable to Direct Memory Access (DMA) attacks when the computer is turned on or is in the Standby power state - this includes when the workstation is locked.
BitLocker with TPM-only authentication lets a computer enter the power-on state without any pre-boot authentication. Therefore, an attacker may be able to perform DMA attacks.
This issue is documented in Microsoft Knowledge Base article 2516445: Blocking the SBP-2 driver and Thunderbolt controllers to reduce 1394 DMA and Thunderbolt DMA threats to BitLocker.

 BitLocker (BL) - optional add-on for when BitLocker is deployed Description:
This policy setting allows you to specify a list of Plug and Play hardware IDs and compatible IDs for devices that Windows is prevented from installing. This policy setting takes precedence over any other policy setting that allows Windows to install a device.
If you enable this policy setting, Windows is prevented from installing a device whose hardware ID or compatible ID appears in the list you create. If you enable this policy setting on a remote desktop server, the policy setting affects redirection of the specified devices from a remote desktop client to the remote desktop server.
If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, devices can be installed and updated as allowed or prevented by other policy settings.
The recommended state for this setting is: PCI\CC_0C0A
Note: This device ID is for Thunderbolt controllers. The USB Type-C (USB-C) port standard that is now common in many computers, especially laptops, utilizes Thunderbolt technology, and therefore may be affected by this restriction. If your organization needs to use USB-C extensively, you may need to decide, internally, to allow yourselves an exception to this recommendation. However, please ensure that all necessary decision-makers have accepted the increased risk of BitLocker encryption key theft (and therefore data theft) via malicious Thunderbolt devices (when left unattended), by doing so.
Note #2: In versions of Windows 10 Release 1803 (and newer), there is a new control named Enumeration policy for external devices incompatible with Kernel DMA Protection available that mitigates much of the risk for malicious devices that may perform Direct Memory Access (DMA) attacks. The newer control is also now part of the Windows 10 CIS benchmark, in section 18.8.26.

18.8.14.1 (L1) Ensure 'Boot-Start Driver Initialization Policy' is set to 'Enabled: Good, unknown and bad but critical' (Automated)

  description: |
	This policy setting allows you to specify which boot-start drivers are initialized based on a classification determined by an Early Launch Antimalware boot-start driver. The Early Launch Antimalware boot-start driver can return the following classifications for each boot-start driver:
	 Good: The driver has been signed and has not been tampered with.
	 Bad: The driver has been identified as malware. It is recommended that you do
	not allow known bad drivers to be initialized.
	 Bad, but required for boot: The driver has been identified as malware, but the
	computer cannot successfully boot without loading this driver.
	 Unknown: This driver has not been attested to by your malware detection
	application and has not been classified by the Early Launch Antimalware boot- start driver.
	If you enable this policy setting you will be able to choose which boot-start drivers to initialize the next time the computer is started.
	If your malware detection application does not include an Early Launch Antimalware boot-start driver or if your Early Launch Antimalware boot-start driver has been disabled, this setting has no effect and all boot-start drivers are initialized.
	The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Good, unknown and bad but critical.
	Rationale:
	This policy setting helps reduce the impact of malware that has already infected your system.

18.8.22.1.3 (L2) Ensure 'Turn off handwriting personalization data sharing' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

This setting turns off data sharing from the handwriting recognition personalization tool.
The handwriting recognition personalization tool enables Tablet PC users to adapt handwriting recognition to their own writing style by providing writing samples.

18.8.22.1.14 (L2) Ensure 'Turn off Windows Error Reporting' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

  description: |
	This policy setting controls whether or not errors are reported to Microsoft.
	Error Reporting is used to report information about a system or application that has failed or has stopped responding and is used to improve the quality of the product.
	The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.
	Rationale:
	If a Windows Error occurs in a secure, enterprise managed environment, the error should be reported directly to IT staff for troubleshooting and remediation. There is no benefit to the corporation to report these errors directly to Microsoft, and there is some risk of unknowingly exposing sensitive data as part of the error.

  description: |
	This policy setting allows you to set support for Kerberos to attempt authentication using the certificate for the device to the domain.
	Support for device authentication using certificate will require connectivity to a DC in the device account domain which supports certificate authentication for computer accounts.
	The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Automatic.
	Rationale:
	Having stronger device authentication with the use of certificates is strongly encouraged over standard username and password authentication. Having this set to Automatic will allow certificate based authentication to be used whenever possible.

18.8.26.1 (BL) Ensure 'Enumeration policy for external devices incompatible with Kernel DMA Protection' is set to 'Enabled: Block All' (Automated)

This policy is intended to provide additional security against external DMA-capable devices. It allows for more control over the enumeration of external DMA-capable devices that are not compatible with DMA Remapping/device memory isolation and sandboxing.
The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Block All.
Note: This policy does not apply to 1394, PCMCIA or ExpressCard devices. The protection also only applies to Windows 10 R1803 or higher, and also requires a UEFI BIOS to function.
Note #2: More information on this feature is available at this link: Kernel DMA Protection for ThunderboltTM 3 (Windows 10) | Microsoft Docs.
Rationale:
Device memory sandboxing allows the OS to leverage the I/O Memory Management Unit (IOMMU) of a device to block unpermitted I/O, or memory access, by the peripheral.

18.8.37.2 (L1) Ensure 'Restrict Unauthenticated RPC clients' is set to 'Enabled: Authenticated' (Automated)

  description: |
	This policy setting controls how the RPC server runtime handles unauthenticated RPC clients connecting to RPC servers.
	This policy setting impacts all RPC applications. In a domain environment this policy setting should be used with caution as it can impact a wide range of functionality including group policy processing itself. Reverting a change to this policy setting can require manual intervention on each affected machine. This policy setting should never be applied to a Domain Controller.
	A client will be considered an authenticated client if it uses a named pipe to communicate with the server or if it uses RPC Security. RPC Interfaces that have specifically requested to be accessible by unauthenticated clients may be exempt from this restriction, depending on the selected value for this policy setting.
	-- "None" allows all RPC clients to connect to RPC Servers running on the machine on which the policy setting is applied.
	-- "Authenticated" allows only authenticated RPC Clients (per the definition above) to connect to RPC Servers running on the machine on which the policy setting is applied. Exemptions are granted to interfaces that have requested them.
	-- "Authenticated without exceptions" allows only authenticated RPC Clients (per the definition above) to connect to RPC Servers running on the machine on which the policy setting is applied. No exceptions are allowed. This value has the potential to cause serious problems and is not recommended.
	Note: This policy setting will not be applied until the system is rebooted. The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Authenticated. Rationale:
	Unauthenticated RPC communication can create a security vulnerability. Impact:
	None - this is the default behavior.

18.8.48.11.1 (L2) Ensure 'Enable/Disable PerfTrack' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)

  description: |
	This policy setting specifies whether to enable or disable tracking of responsiveness events.
	The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.
	Rationale:
	When enabled the aggregated data of a given event will be transmitted to Microsoft.

This policy setting configures whether or not fixed data drives formatted with the FAT file system can be unlocked and viewed on computers running Windows Server 2008 (non-R2), Windows Vista, Windows XP with Service Pack 3 (SP3), or Windows XP with Service Pack 2 (SP2) operating systems.
Note: This policy setting does not apply to drives that are formatted with the NTFS file system.
The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.
Rationale:
By default BitLocker virtualizes FAT formatted drives to permit access via the BitLocker To Go Reader on previous versions of Windows. Additionally the BitLocker To Go Reader application is applied to the unencrypted portion of the drive.
The BitLocker To Go Reader application, like any other application, is subject to spoofing and could be a mechanism to propagate malware.

18.9.11.1.2 (BL) Ensure 'Choose how BitLocker-protected fixed drives can be recovered' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

 BitLocker (BL) - optional add-on for when BitLocker is deployed Description:
This policy setting allows you to control how BitLocker-protected fixed data drives are recovered in the absence of the required credentials. This policy setting is applied when you turn on BitLocker.
The "Allow data recovery agent" check box is used to specify whether a Data Recovery Agent can be used with BitLocker-protected fixed data drives. Before a Data Recovery Agent can be used it must be added from the Public Key Policies item in either the Group Policy Management Console or the Local Group Policy Editor. Consult the BitLocker Drive Encryption Deployment Guide on Microsoft TechNet for more information about adding Data Recovery Agents.
In "Configure user storage of BitLocker recovery information" select whether users are allowed, required, or not allowed to generate a 48-digit recovery password or a 256-bit recovery key.
Select "Omit recovery options from the BitLocker setup wizard" to prevent users from specifying recovery options when they enable BitLocker on a drive. This means that you will not be able to specify which recovery option to use when you enable BitLocker, instead BitLocker recovery options for the drive are determined by the policy setting.
In "Save BitLocker recovery information to Active Directory Domain Services" choose which BitLocker recovery information to store in AD DS for fixed data drives. If you select "Backup recovery password and key package", both the BitLocker recovery password and key package are stored in AD DS. Storing the key package supports recovering data from a drive that has been physically corrupted. If you select "Backup recovery password only", only the recovery password is stored in AD DS.
Select the "Do not enable BitLocker until recovery information is stored in AD DS for fixed data drives" check box if you want to prevent users from enabling BitLocker unless the computer is connected to the domain and the backup of BitLocker recovery information to AD DS succeeds.
Note: If the "Do not enable BitLocker until recovery information is stored in AD DS for fixed data drives" check box is selected, a recovery password is automatically generated.
The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

Rationale:
Administrators should always have a safe, secure way to access encrypted data in the event users cannot access their data.
Additionally, as with any authentication method, a drive can be compromised by guessing or finding the authentication information used to access the drive.

 BitLocker (BL) - optional add-on for when BitLocker is deployed Description:
This policy setting allows you to manage BitLocker's use of hardware-based encryption on fixed data drives and specify which encryption algorithms it can use with hardware- based encryption. Using hardware-based encryption can improve performance of drive operations that involve frequent reading or writing of data to the drive.
You can specify additional options that control whether BitLocker software-based encryption is used instead of hardware-based encryption on computers that do not support hardware-based encryption and whether you want to restrict the encryption algorithms and cipher suites used with hardware-based encryption.

  description: |
	This policy setting allows you to specify whether smart cards must be used to authenticate user access to the BitLocker-protected fixed data drives on a computer.
	Smart cards can be used to authenticate user access to the drive. You can require a smart card authentication by selecting the "Require use of smart cards on fixed data drives" check box.
	Note: This setting is enforced when turning on BitLocker, not when unlocking a drive. BitLocker will allow unlocking a drive with any of the protectors available on the drive.

18.9.11.2 Operating System Drives
This section contains recommendations for configuring Operating System Drives in BitLocker.
This Group Policy section is provided by the Group Policy template VolumeEncryption.admx/adml that is included with the Microsoft Windows 7 & Server 2008 R2 Administrative Templates (or newer).

18.9.11.2.1 (BL) Ensure 'Allow enhanced PINs for startup' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

 BitLocker (BL) - optional add-on for when BitLocker is deployed
  description: |
	This policy setting allows you to configure whether or not enhanced startup PINs are used with BitLocker.
	Enhanced startup PINs permit the use of characters including uppercase and lowercase letters, symbols, numbers, and spaces. This policy setting is applied when you turn on BitLocker.
	The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.
	Rationale:
	A numeric-only PIN provides less entropy than a PIN that is alpha-numeric. When not using enhanced PIN for startup, BitLocker requires the use of the function keys [F1-F10] for PIN entry since the PIN is entered in the pre-OS environment before localization support is available. This limits each PIN digit to one of ten possibilities. The TPM has an anti-hammering feature that includes a mechanism to exponentially increase the delay for PIN retry attempts; however, an attacker is able to more effectively mount a brute force attack using a domain of 10 digits of the function keys.

5.2 Use Unique Passwords
Use unique passwords for all enterprise assets. Best practice implementation
includes, at a minimum, an 8-character password for accounts using MFA and a 14-character password for accounts not using MFA.

16.3 Require Multi-factor Authentication
Require multi-factor authentication for all user accounts, on all systems,
whether managed onsite or by a third-party provider.

18.9.11.2.2 (BL) Ensure 'Allow Secure Boot for integrity validation' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

 BitLocker (BL) - optional add-on for when BitLocker is deployed
  description: |
	This policy setting allows you to configure whether Secure Boot will be allowed as the platform integrity provider for BitLocker operating system drives.
	Secure Boot ensures that the PC's pre-boot environment only loads firmware that is digitally signed by authorized software publishers. Secure Boot also provides more flexibility for managing pre-boot configuration than legacy BitLocker integrity checks.
	Secure Boot requires a system that meets the UEFI 2.3.1 Specifications for Class 2 and Class 3 computers.
	When this policy is enabled and the hardware is capable of using Secure Boot for BitLocker scenarios, the "Use enhanced Boot Configuration Data validation profile" group policy setting is ignored and Secure Boot verifies BCD settings according to the Secure Boot policy setting, which is configured separately from BitLocker.
	Note: If the group policy setting "Configure TPM platform validation profile for native UEFI firmware configurations" is enabled and has PCR 7 omitted, BitLocker will be prevented from using Secure Boot for platform or Boot Configuration Data (BCD) integrity validation.
	The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.
	Rationale:
	Secure Boot ensures that only firmware digitally signed by authorized software publishers is loaded during computer startup, which reduces the risk of rootkits and other types of malware from gaining control of the system. It also helps provide protection against malicious users booting from an alternate operating system.

18.9.11.2.3 (BL) Ensure 'Choose how BitLocker-protected operating system drives can be recovered' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

 BitLocker (BL) - optional add-on for when BitLocker is deployed Description:
This policy setting allows you to control how BitLocker-protected operating system drives are recovered in the absence of the required startup key information. This policy setting is applied when you turn on BitLocker.
The "Allow certificate-based data recovery agent" check box is used to specify whether a Data Recovery Agent can be used with BitLocker-protected operating system drives. Before a Data Recovery Agent can be used it must be added from the Public Key Policies item in either the Group Policy Management Console or the Local Group Policy Editor. Consult the BitLocker Drive Encryption Deployment Guide on Microsoft TechNet for more information about adding Data Recovery Agents.
In "Configure user storage of BitLocker recovery information" select whether users are allowed, required, or not allowed to generate a 48-digit recovery password or a 256-bit recovery key.
Select "Omit recovery options from the BitLocker setup wizard" to prevent users from specifying recovery options when they enable BitLocker on a drive. This means that you will not be able to specify which recovery option to use when you enable BitLocker, instead BitLocker recovery options for the drive are determined by the policy setting.
In "Save BitLocker recovery information to Active Directory Domain Services", choose which BitLocker recovery information to store in AD DS for operating system drives. If you select "Backup recovery password and key package", both the BitLocker recovery password and key package are stored in AD DS. Storing the key package supports recovering data from a drive that has been physically corrupted. If you select "Backup recovery password only", only the recovery password is stored in AD DS.
Select the "Do not enable BitLocker until recovery information is stored in AD DS for operating system drives" check box if you want to prevent users from enabling BitLocker unless the computer is connected to the domain and the backup of BitLocker recovery information to AD DS succeeds.

Note: If the "Do not enable BitLocker until recovery information is stored in AD DS for operating system drives" check box is selected, a recovery password is automatically generated.
The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.
Rationale:
Should a user lose their primary means for accessing an encrypted OS volume, or should the system not pass its boot time integrity checks, the system will go into recovery mode. If the recovery key has not been backed up to Active Directory, the user would need to have saved the recovery key to another location such as a USB flash drive, or have printed the recovery password, and now have access to one of those in order to recovery the system. If the user is unable to produce the recovery key, then the user will be denied access to the encrypted volume and subsequently any data that is stored there.

If the recovery key has not been backed up to Active Directory, the user would need to have saved the recovery key to another location such as a USB flash drive, or have printed the recovery password, and now have access to one of those in order to recovery the system. If the user is unable to produce the recovery key, then the user will be denied access to the encrypted volume and subsequently any data that is stored there.

18.9.11.2.11 (BL) Ensure 'Configure use of hardware-based encryption for operating system drives' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)

 BitLocker (BL) - optional add-on for when BitLocker is deployed Description:
This policy setting allows you to manage BitLocker's use of hardware-based encryption on operating system drives and specify which encryption algorithms it can use with hardware-based encryption. Using hardware-based encryption can improve performance of drive operations that involve frequent reading or writing of data to the drive.
You can specify additional options that control whether BitLocker software-based encryption is used instead of hardware-based encryption on computers that do not support hardware-based encryption and whether you want to restrict the encryption algorithms and cipher suites used with hardware-based encryption.
The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.
Rationale:
From a security perspective hardware-based encryption may introduce vulnerabilities in the hardware encryption of certain self-encrypting drives (SEDs), if the vendor and/or user has not updated the firmware to remediate the vulnerability. For more information visit ADV180028 - Security Update Guide - Microsoft - Guidance for configuring BitLocker to enforce software encryption.

  description: |
	This policy setting specifies the constraints for passwords used to unlock BitLocker- protected operating system drives.
	Note: This setting is enforced when turning on BitLocker, not when unlocking a volume. BitLocker will allow unlocking a drive with any of the protectors available on the drive.
	The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.
	Rationale:
	Using a dictionary-style attack, passwords can be guessed or discovered by repeatedly attempting to unlock a drive. Since this type of BitLocker password does include anti- dictionary attack protections provided by a TPM, for example, there is no mechanism to slow down rapid brute-force attacks against them.

18.9.11.2.13 (BL) Ensure 'Require additional authentication at startup' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

 BitLocker (BL) - optional add-on for when BitLocker is deployed Description:
This policy setting allows you to configure whether BitLocker requires additional authentication each time the computer starts and whether you are using BitLocker with or without a Trusted Platform Module (TPM). This policy setting is applied when you turn on BitLocker.
Note: Only one of the additional authentication options can be required at startup, otherwise a policy error occurs.
If you want to use BitLocker on a computer without a TPM, select the "Allow BitLocker without a compatible TPM" check box. In this mode a USB drive is required for start-up and the key information used to encrypt the drive is stored on the USB drive, creating a USB key. When the USB key is inserted the access to the drive is authenticated and the drive is accessible. If the USB key is lost or unavailable you will need to use one of the BitLocker recovery options to access the drive.
On a computer with a compatible TPM, four types of authentication methods can be used at startup to provide added protection for encrypted data. When the computer starts, it can use only the TPM for authentication, or it can also require insertion of a USB flash drive containing a startup key, the entry of a 4-digit to 20-digit personal identification number (PIN), or both.
Users can configure advanced startup options in the BitLocker setup wizard.
Note #2: If you want to require the use of a startup PIN and a USB flash drive, you must configure BitLocker settings using the command-line tool manage-bde instead of the BitLocker Drive Encryption setup wizard.
The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.
Rationale:
TPM without use of a PIN will only validate early boot components and does not require a user to enter any additional authentication information. If a computer is lost or stolen in this configuration, BitLocker will not provide any additional measure of protection beyond what is provided by native Windows authentication unless the early boot components are tampered with or the encrypted drive is removed from the machine.

18.9.11.3 Removable Data Drives
This section contains recommendations for configuring Removable Data Drives in BitLocker.
This Group Policy section is provided by the Group Policy template VolumeEncryption.admx/adml that is included with the Microsoft Windows 7 & Server 2008 R2 Administrative Templates (or newer).

18.9.11.3.1 (BL) Ensure 'Allow access to BitLocker-protected removable data drives from earlier versions of Windows' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)

 BitLocker (BL) - optional add-on for when BitLocker is deployed Description:
This policy setting configures whether or not removable data drives formatted with the FAT file system can be unlocked and viewed on computers running Windows Server 2008 (non-R2), Windows Vista, Windows XP with Service Pack 3 (SP3), or Windows XP with Service Pack 2 (SP2) operating systems.
Note: This policy setting does not apply to drives that are formatted with the NTFS file system.
The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.
Rationale:
By default BitLocker virtualizes FAT formatted drives to permit access via the BitLocker To Go Reader on previous versions of Windows. Additionally the BitLocker To Go Reader application is applied to the unencrypted portion of the drive.
The BitLocker To Go Reader application, like any other application, is subject to spoofing and could be a mechanism to propagate malware.

18.9.11.3.2 (BL) Ensure 'Choose how BitLocker-protected removable drives can be recovered' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

 BitLocker (BL) - optional add-on for when BitLocker is deployed Description:
This policy setting allows you to control how BitLocker-protected removable data drives are recovered in the absence of the required credentials. This policy setting is applied when you turn on BitLocker.
The "Allow data recovery agent" check box is used to specify whether a Data Recovery Agent can be used with BitLocker-protected removable data drives. Before a Data Recovery Agent can be used it must be added from the Public Key Policies item in either the Group Policy Management Console or the Local Group Policy Editor. Consult the BitLocker Drive Encryption Deployment Guide on Microsoft TechNet for more information about adding Data Recovery Agents.
In "Configure user storage of BitLocker recovery information" select whether users are allowed, required, or not allowed to generate a 48-digit recovery password or a 256-bit recovery key.
Select "Omit recovery options from the BitLocker setup wizard" to prevent users from specifying recovery options when they enable BitLocker on a drive. This means that you will not be able to specify which recovery option to use when you enable BitLocker, instead BitLocker recovery options for the drive are determined by the policy setting.
In "Save BitLocker recovery information to Active Directory Domain Services" choose which BitLocker recovery information to store in AD DS for removable data drives. If you select "Backup recovery password and key package", both the BitLocker recovery password and key package are stored in AD DS. If you select "Backup recovery password only", only the recovery password is stored in AD DS.
Select the "Do not enable BitLocker until recovery information is stored in AD DS for removable data drives" check box if you want to prevent users from enabling BitLocker unless the computer is connected to the domain and the backup of BitLocker recovery information to AD DS succeeds.
Note: If the "Do not enable BitLocker until recovery information is stored in AD DS for removable data drives" check box is selected, a recovery password is automatically generated.
The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

Rationale:
Administrators should always have a safe, secure way to access encrypted data in the event users cannot access their data.
Additionally, as with any authentication method, a drive can be compromised by guessing or finding the authentication information used to access the drive.

This policy setting allows you to control how BitLocker-protected removable data drives are recovered in the absence of the required credentials. This policy setting is applied when you turn on BitLocker.
In "Save BitLocker recovery information to Active Directory Domain Services" choose which BitLocker recovery information to store in AD DS for removable data drives. If you select "Backup recovery password and key package", both the BitLocker recovery password and key package are stored in AD DS. If you select "Backup recovery password only", only the recovery password is stored in AD DS.
The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Backup recovery passwords and key packages.
Rationale:
Administrators should always have a safe, secure way to access encrypted data in the event users cannot access their data.
Additionally, as with any authentication method, a drive can be compromised by guessing or finding the authentication information used to access the drive.
To use BitLocker a Data Recovery Agent will need to be configured for removable drives. To recover a drive will require highly-controlled access to the Data Recovery Agent private key.

 BitLocker (BL) - optional add-on for when BitLocker is deployed Description:
This policy setting allows you to control how BitLocker-protected removable data drives are recovered in the absence of the required credentials. This policy setting is applied when you turn on BitLocker.
Select the "Do not enable BitLocker until recovery information is stored in AD DS for removable data drives" check box if you want to prevent users from enabling BitLocker unless the computer is connected to the domain and the backup of BitLocker recovery information to AD DS succeeds.
Note: If the "Do not enable BitLocker until recovery information is stored in AD DS for removable data drives" check box is selected, a recovery password is automatically generated.
The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: False (unchecked).

18.9.11.3.10 (BL) Ensure 'Configure use of hardware-based encryption for removable data drives' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)

 BitLocker (BL) - optional add-on for when BitLocker is deployed Description:
This policy setting allows you to manage BitLocker's use of hardware-based encryption on removable data drives and specify which encryption algorithms it can use with hardware-based encryption. Using hardware-based encryption can improve performance of drive operations that involve frequent reading or writing of data to the drive.
You can specify additional options that control whether BitLocker software-based encryption is used instead of hardware-based encryption on computers that do not support hardware-based encryption and whether you want to restrict the encryption algorithms and cipher suites used with hardware-based encryption.
The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.
Rationale:
From a security perspective hardware-based encryption may introduce vulnerabilities in the hardware encryption of certain self-encrypting drives (SEDs), if the vendor and/or user has not updated the firmware to remediate the vulnerability. For more information visit ADV180028 - Security Update Guide - Microsoft - Guidance for configuring BitLocker to enforce software encryption.

	Note: This setting is enforced when turning on BitLocker, not when unlocking a drive. BitLocker will allow unlocking a drive with any of the protectors available on the drive.
	The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.
	Rationale:
	Using a dictionary-style attack, passwords can be guessed or discovered by repeatedly attempting to unlock a drive. Since this type of BitLocker password does not include anti-dictionary attack protections provided by a TPM, for example, there is no mechanism to slow down use of rapid brute-force attacks against them.

18.9.15.1 (L1) Ensure 'Require pin for pairing' is set to 'Enabled: First Time' OR 'Enabled: Always' (Automated)

  description: |
	This policy setting controls whether or not a PIN is required for pairing to a wireless display device.
	The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: First Time OR Enabled: Always.
	Rationale:
	If this setting is not configured or disabled then a PIN would not be required when pairing wireless display devices to the system, increasing the risk of unauthorized use.

18.9.17.1 (L1) Ensure 'Allow Diagnostic Data' is set to 'Enabled: Diagnostic data off (not recommended)' or 'Enabled: Send required diagnostic data' (Automated)

  description: |
	This policy setting determines the amount of diagnostic and usage data reported to Microsoft:
	 A value of (0) Diagnostic data off (not recommended). Using this value, no diagnostic data is sent from the device. This value is only supported on Enterprise, Education, and Server editions. If you choose this setting, devices in your organization will still be secure.
	 A value of (1) Send required diagnostic data. This is the minimum diagnostic data necessary to keep Windows secure, up to date, and performing as expected. Using this value disables the Optional diagnostic data control in the Settings app.
	 A value of (3)Send optional diagnostic data. Additional diagnostic data is collected that helps us to detect, diagnose and fix issues, as well as make product improvements. Required diagnostic data will always be included when you choose to send optional diagnostic data. Optional diagnostic data can also include diagnostic log files and crash dumps. Use the Limit Dump Collection and the Limit Diagnostic Log Collection policies for more granular control of what optional diagnostic data is sent.
	Windows telemetry settings apply to the Windows operating system and some first party apps. This setting does not apply to third party apps running on Windows 10/11.
	The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Diagnostic data off (not recommended) or Enabled: Send required diagnostic data.
	Note: If your organization relies on Windows Update, the minimum recommended setting is Required diagnostic data. Because no Windows Update information is collected when diagnostic data is off, important information about update failures is not sent. Microsoft uses this information to fix the causes of those failures and improve the quality of updates.
	Note #2: The Configure diagnostic data opt-in settings user interface group policy can be used to prevent end users from changing their data collection settings.

	Note #3: Enhanced diagnostic data setting is not available on Windows 11 and Windows Server 2022 and has been replaced with policies that can control the amount of optional diagnostic data that is sent. For more information on these settings visit Manage diagnostic data using Group Policy and MDM
	Rationale:
	Sending any data to a 3rd party vendor is a security concern and should only be done on an as needed basis.

  description: |
	Without heap termination on corruption, legacy plug-in applications may continue to function when a File Explorer session has become corrupt. Ensuring that heap termination on corruption is active will prevent this.
	The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.
	Rationale:
	Allowing an application to function after its session has become corrupt increases the risk posture to the system.

18.9.31.4 (L1) Ensure 'Turn off shell protocol protected mode' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)

  description: |
	This policy setting allows you to configure the amount of functionality that the shell protocol can have. When using the full functionality of this protocol, applications can open folders and launch files. The protected mode reduces the functionality of this protocol allowing applications to only open a limited set of folders. Applications are not able to open files with this protocol when it is in the protected mode. It is recommended to leave this protocol in the protected mode to increase the security of Windows.
	The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.
	Rationale:
	Limiting the opening of files and folders to a limited set reduces the attack surface of the system.

  description: |
	This policy setting allows you to join Microsoft Active Protection Service (MAPS), which Microsoft renamed to Windows Defender Antivirus Cloud Protection Service and then Microsoft Defender Antivirus Cloud Protection Service. Microsoft MAPS / Microsoft Defender Antivirus Cloud Protection Service is the online community that helps you choose how to respond to potential threats. The community also helps stop the spread of new malicious software infections. You can choose to send basic or additional information about detected software. Additional information helps Microsoft create new definitions and help it to protect your computer.
	Possible options are:
	 (0x0) Disabled (default)
	 (0x1) Basic membership
	 (0x2) Advanced membership
	Basic membership will send basic information to Microsoft about software that has been detected including where the software came from the actions that you apply or that are applied automatically and whether the actions were successful.
	Advanced membership in addition to basic information will send more information to Microsoft about malicious software spyware and potentially unwanted software including the location of the software file names how the software operates and how it has impacted your computer.
	The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.
	Rationale:
	The information that would be sent can include things like location of detected items on your computer if harmful software was removed. The information would be automatically collected and sent. In some instances personal information might unintentionally be sent to Microsoft. However, Microsoft states that it will not use this information to identify you or contact you.
	For privacy reasons in high security environments, it is best to prevent these data submissions altogether.

	When running an antivirus solution such as Microsoft Defender Antivirus, it is important to ensure that it is configured to monitor for suspicious and known malicious activity. File hashes are a reliable way of detecting changes to files, and can speed up the scan process by skipping files that have not changed since they were last scanned and determined to be safe. A changed file hash can also be cause for additional scrutiny.

18.9.57.1 (L2) Ensure 'Enable news and interests on the taskbar' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)

This policy setting specifies whether the news and interests feature is allowed on the device.
The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled. Rationale:
Due to privacy concerns, apps and features such as news and interests on the Windows taskbar should be treated as a possible security risk due to the potential of data being sent back to 3rd parties, such as Microsoft.
In addition, the app may display inappropriate news and interests within the feed. Impact:
The news and interests feature on the Windows taskbar will not be available on the device.
Note: At time of benchmark publication, this setting does not hide or disable the taskbar menu options for the news and interests feature, however attempting to turn the feature back on does not cause any visible change. It is possible that Microsoft will modify this behavior to "gray out" the taskbar menu options in a future OS update.

18.9.58.1 (L1) Ensure 'Prevent the usage of OneDrive for file storage' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

  description: |
	This policy setting lets you prevent apps and features from working with files on OneDrive using the Next Generation Sync Client.
	The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.
	Rationale:
	Enabling this setting prevents users from accidentally (or intentionally) uploading confidential or sensitive corporate information to the OneDrive cloud service using the Next Generation Sync Client.
	Note: This security concern applies to any cloud-based file storage application installed on a workstation, not just the one supplied with Windows.

  query: |  <LOOK FOR POTENTIAL QURIES IN THE NEXT FEW LINES. THIS IS A SCRIPT BASED EFFORT SO GO TO THE DOC FOR ANY DOUBTS.>     
Remediation:
To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to Enabled:

                     Potential value to compare:  --------------------->   'Enabled'

Note: This Group Policy path may not exist by default. It is provided by the Group Policy template SkyDrive.admx/adml that is included with the Microsoft Windows 8.1 & Server 2012 R2 Administrative Templates (or newer). However, we strongly recommend you only use the version included with the Microsoft Windows 10 Release 1607 & Server 2016 Administrative Templates (or newer). Older versions of the templates had conflicting settings in different template files for both OneDrive & SkyDrive, until it was cleaned up properly in the above version.
Note #2: In older Microsoft Windows Administrative Templates, this setting was named Prevent the usage of SkyDrive for file storage, but it was renamed starting with the Windows 10 RTM (Release 1507) Administrative Templates.

  description: |
	This policy setting determines whether User Interface (UI) Automation client applications running on the local computer can access UI elements on the server.
	UI Automation gives programs access to most UI elements, which allows use of assistive technology products like Magnifier and Narrator that need to interact with the UI in order to work properly. UI information also allows automated test scripts to interact with the UI. For example, the local computer ́s Narrator and Magnifier clients can be used to interact with UI on a web page opened in a remote session.
	The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.
	Note: Remote Desktop sessions don ́t currently support UI Automation redirection. Rationale:
	In a more security-sensitive environment, it is desirable to reduce the possible attack surface. The need for UI Automation redirection within a Remote Desktop session is rare, and not supported at this time, but it makes sense to reduce the number of unexpected avenues for malicious activity to occur.

	Security (TLS) version 1.0, not the older (and less secure) SSL protocol.
	Rationale:
	The native Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) encryption is now considered a weak protocol, so enforcing the use of stronger Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption for all RDP communications between clients and RD Session Host servers is preferred.

18.9.65.3.10.1 (L2) Ensure 'Set time limit for active but idle Remote Desktop Services sessions' is set to 'Enabled: 15 minutes or less, but not Never (0)' (Automated)

  description: |
	This policy setting allows you to specify the maximum amount of time that an active Remote Desktop Services session can be idle (without user input) before it is automatically disconnected.
	The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: 15 minutes or less, but not Never (0).
	Rationale:
	This setting helps to prevent active Remote Desktop sessions from tying up the computer for long periods of time while not in use, preventing computing resources from being consumed by large numbers of inactive sessions. In addition, old, forgotten Remote Desktop sessions that are still active can cause password lockouts if the user's password has changed but the old session is still running. For systems that limit the number of connected users (e.g. servers in the default Administrative mode - 2 sessions only), other users' old but still active sessions can prevent another user from connecting, resulting in an effective denial of service.

  description: |
	The Key Management Service (KMS) is a Microsoft license activation method that entails setting up a local server to store the software licenses. The KMS server itself needs to connect to Microsoft to activate the KMS service, but subsequent on-network clients can activate Microsoft Windows OS and/or their Microsoft Office via the KMS server instead of connecting directly to Microsoft. This policy setting lets you opt-out of sending KMS client activation data to Microsoft automatically.
	The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.
	Rationale:
	Even though the KMS licensing method does not require KMS clients to connect to Microsoft, they still send KMS client activation state data to Microsoft automatically. Preventing this information from being sent can help reduce privacy concerns in high security environments.

	Note #2: The name of this setting and the Enabled/Disabled values are incorrectly worded – logically, the title implies that configuring it to Enabled will disable all apps from the Microsoft Store, and configuring it to Disabled will enable all apps from the Microsoft Store. The opposite is true (and is consistent with the GPME help text). This is a logical wording mistake by Microsoft in the Administrative Template.
	Rationale:
	The Store service is a retail outlet built into Windows, primarily for consumer use. In an enterprise managed environment the IT department should be managing the installation of all applications to reduce the risk of the installation of vulnerable software.

18.9.90.1 (L1) Ensure 'Allow user control over installs' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)

  description: |
	This setting controls whether users are permitted to change installation options that typically are available only to system administrators. The security features of Windows Installer normally prevent users from changing installation options that are typically reserved for system administrators, such as specifying the directory to which files are installed. If Windows Installer detects that an installation package has permitted the user to change a protected option, it stops the installation and displays a message. These security features operate only when the installation program is running in a privileged security context in which it has access to directories denied to the user.
	The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.
	Rationale:
	In an enterprise managed environment, only IT staff with administrative rights should be installing or changing software on a system. Allowing users the ability to have any control over installs can risk unapproved software from being installed or removed from a system, which could cause the system to become vulnerable to compromise.

This policy setting enables logging of all PowerShell script input to the Applications and Services Logs\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\Operational Event Log channel.
The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.
Note: If logging of Script Block Invocation Start/Stop Events is enabled (option box checked), PowerShell will log additional events when invocation of a command, script block, function, or script starts or stops. Enabling this option generates a high volume of event logs. CIS has intentionally chosen not to make a recommendation for this option, since it generates a large volume of events. If an organization chooses to enable the optional setting (checked), this also conforms to the benchmark.
Rationale:
Logs of PowerShell script input can be very valuable when performing forensic investigations of PowerShell attack incidents to determine what occurred.

18.9.102.1.1 (L1) Ensure 'Allow Basic authentication' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)

  description: |
	This policy setting allows you to manage whether the Windows Remote Management (WinRM) client uses Basic authentication.
	The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.
	Note: Clients that use Microsoft's Exchange Online service (Office 365) will require an exception to this recommendation, to instead have this setting set to Enabled. Exchange Online uses Basic authentication over HTTPS, and so the Exchange Online authentication traffic will still be safely encrypted.
	Rationale:
	Basic authentication is less robust than other authentication methods available in WinRM because credentials including passwords are transmitted in plain text. An attacker who is able to capture packets on the network where WinRM is running may be able to determine the credentials used for accessing remote hosts via WinRM.

18.9.108.1.1 (L1) Ensure 'No auto-restart with logged on users for scheduled automatic updates installations' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)

  description: |
	This policy setting specifies that Automatic Updates will wait for computers to be restarted by the users who are logged on to them to complete a scheduled installation.
	The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.
	Note: This setting applies only when you configure Automatic Updates to perform scheduled update installations. If you configure the Configure Automatic Updates setting to Disabled, this setting has no effect.
	Rationale:
	Some security updates require that the computer be restarted to complete an installation. If the computer cannot restart automatically, then the most recent update will not completely install and no new updates will download to the computer until it is restarted. Without the auto-restart functionality, users who are not security-conscious may choose to indefinitely delay the restart, therefore keeping the computer in a less secure state.

18.9.108.2.1 (L1) Ensure 'Configure Automatic Updates' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

  description: |
	This policy setting specifies whether computers in your environment will receive security updates from Windows Update or WSUS. If you configure this policy setting to Enabled, the operating system will recognize when a network connection is available and then use the network connection to search Windows Update or your designated intranet site for updates that apply to them.
	After you configure this policy setting to Enabled, select one of the following three options in the Configure Automatic Updates Properties dialog box to specify how the service will work:
	 2 - Notify for download and auto install (Notify before downloading any updates)
	 3 - Auto download and notify for install (Download the updates automatically and
	notify when they are ready to be installed.) (Default setting)
	 4 - Auto download and schedule the install (Automatically download updates and
	install them on the schedule specified below.))
	 5 - Allow local admin to choose setting (Leave decision on above choices up to
	the local Administrators (Not Recommended))
	The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.
	Note: The sub-setting "Configure automatic updating:" has 4 possible values – all of them are valid depending on specific organizational needs, however if feasible we suggest using a value of 4 - Auto download and schedule the install. This suggestion is not a scored requirement.
	Note #2: Organizations that utilize a 3rd-party solution for patching may choose to exempt themselves from this recommendation, and instead configure it to Disabled so that the native Windows Update mechanism does not interfere with the 3rd-party patching process.
	Rationale:
	Although each version of Windows is thoroughly tested before release, it is possible that problems will be discovered after the products are shipped. The Configure Automatic Updates setting can help you ensure that the computers in your environment will always have the most recent critical operating system updates and service packs installed.

  description: |
	This policy setting manage which updates that are receive prior to the update being released.
	Dev Channel: Ideal for highly technical users. Insiders in the Dev Channel will receive builds from our active development branch that is earliest in a development cycle. These builds are not matched to a specific Windows 10 release.
	Beta Channel: Ideal for feature explorers who want to see upcoming Windows 10 features. Your feedback will be especially important here as it will help our engineers ensure key issues are fixed before a major release.
	Release Preview Channel (default): Insiders in the Release Preview Channel will have access to the upcoming release of Windows 10 prior to it being released to the world. These builds are supported by Microsoft. The Release Preview Channel is where we recommend companies preview and validate upcoming Windows 10 releases before broad deployment within their organization.
	The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.
	Rationale:
	It can be risky for experimental features to be allowed in an enterprise managed environment because this can introduce bugs and security holes into systems, making it easier for an attacker to gain access. It is generally preferred to only use production- ready builds.

18.9.108.4.2 (L1) Ensure 'Select when Preview Builds and Feature Updates are received' is set to 'Enabled: 180 or more days' (Automated)

  description: |
	This policy setting determines when Preview Build or Feature Updates are received.
	Defer Updates This enables devices to defer taking the next Feature Update available to your channel for up to 14 days for all the pre-release channels and up to 365 days for the Semi-Annual Channel. Or, if the device is updating from the Semi-Annual Channel, a version for the device to move to and/or stay on until the policy is updated or the device reaches end of service can be specified. Note: If you set both policies, the version specified will take precedence and the deferrals will not be in effect. Please see the Windows Release Information page for OS version information.
	Pause Updates To prevent Feature Updates from being received on their scheduled time, you can temporarily pause Feature Updates. The pause will remain in effect for 35 days from the specified start date or until the field is cleared (Quality Updates will still be offered).
	Note: If the "Allow Diagnostic Data" (formerly "Allow Telemetry") policy is set to 0, this policy will have no effect.
	Note #2: Starting with Windows 10 R1607, Microsoft introduced a new Windows Update (WU) client behavior called Dual Scan, with an eye to cloud-based update management. In some cases, this Dual Scan feature can interfere with Windows Updates from Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) and/or manual WU updates. If you are using WSUS in your environment, you may need to set the above setting to Not Configured or configure the setting Do not allow update deferral policies to cause scans against Windows Update (added in the Windows 10 Release 1709 Administrative Templates) in order to prevent the Dual Scan feature from interfering. More information on Dual Scan is available at these links:
	 Demystifying “Dual Scan” – WSUS Product Team Blog
	 Improving Dual Scan on 1607 – WSUS Product Team Blog
	Note #3: Prior to Windows 10 R1703, values above 180 days are not recognized by the OS. Starting with Windows 10 R1703, the maximum number of days you can defer is 365 days.

	Rationale:
	In a production environment, it is preferred to only use software and features that are publicly available, after they have gone through rigorous testing in beta.

19.7.4.1 (L1) Ensure 'Do not preserve zone information in file attachments' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)

  description: |
	This policy setting allows you to manage whether Windows marks file attachments with information about their zone of origin (such as restricted, Internet, intranet, local). This requires NTFS in order to function correctly, and will fail without notice on FAT32. By not preserving the zone information, Windows cannot make proper risk assessments.
	The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.
	Note: The Attachment Manager feature warns users when opening or executing files which are marked as being from an untrusted source, unless/until the file's zone information has been removed via the "Unblock" button on the file's properties or via a separate tool such as Microsoft Sysinternals Streams.
	Rationale:
	A file that is downloaded from a computer in the Internet or Restricted Sites zone may be moved to a location that makes it appear safe, like an intranet file share, and executed by an unsuspecting user. The Attachment Manager feature will warn users when opening or executing files which are marked as being from an untrusted source, unless/until the file's zone information has been removed.

19.7.43.1 (L1) Ensure 'Always install with elevated privileges' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)

  description: |
	This setting controls whether or not Windows Installer should use system permissions when it installs any program on the system.
	Note: This setting appears both in the Computer Configuration and User Configuration folders. To make this setting effective, you must enable the setting in both folders.
	Caution: If enabled, skilled users can take advantage of the permissions this setting grants to change their privileges and gain permanent access to restricted files and folders. Note that the User Configuration version of this setting is not guaranteed to be secure.
	The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.
	Rationale:
	Users with limited privileges can exploit this feature by creating a Windows Installer installation package that creates a new local account that belongs to the local built-in Administrators group, adds their current account to the local built-in Administrators group, installs malicious software, or performs other unauthorized activities.

Remediation:
To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to Disabled:

                     Potential value to compare:  --------------------->   'Disabled'

Note: This Group Policy path is provided by the Group Policy template MSI.admx/adml that is included with all versions of the Microsoft Windows Administrative Templates.
  HKEY_USERS\[USER SID]\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer:AlwaysInstallElevated
   User Configuration\Policies\Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Windows Installer\Always install with elevated privileges

Default Value:
Disabled. (Windows Installer will apply the current user's permissions when it installs programs that a system administrator does not distribute or offer. This will prevent standard users from installing applications that affect system-wide configuration items.)

Control
5.4 Restrict Administrator Privileges to Dedicated
Administrator Accounts
Restrict administrator privileges to dedicated administrator accounts on
enterprise assets. Conduct general computing activities, such as internet browsing, email, and productivity suite use, from the user’s primary, non-privileged account.
       v7
4.3 Ensure the Use of Dedicated Administrative Accounts Ensure that all users with administrative account access use a dedicated or secondary account for elevated activities. This account should only be used for
administrative activities and not internet browsing, email, or similar activities.

19.7.47.2.1 (L2) Ensure 'Prevent Codec Download' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

  description: |
	This setting controls whether Windows Media Player is allowed to download additional codecs for decoding media files it does not already understand.
	The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.
	Rationale:
	This has some potential for risk if a malicious data file is opened in Media Player that requires an additional codec to be installed. If a special codec is required for a necessary job function, then that codec should first be tested to ensure it is legitimate, and it should be supplied by the IT department in the organization.
