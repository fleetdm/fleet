  description: |
    This policy setting determines which users can create symbolic links. In Windows Vista, existing
    NTFS file system objects, such as files and folders, can be accessed by referring to a new kind
    of file system object called a symbolic link. A symbolic link is a pointer (much like a shortcut
    or .lnk file) to another file system object, which can be a file, folder, shortcut or another
    symbolic link. The difference between a shortcut and a symbolic link is that a shortcut only
    works from within the Windows shell. To other programs and applications, shortcuts are just
    another file, whereas with symbolic links, the concept of a shortcut is implemented as a feature
    of the NTFS file system. Symbolic links can potentially expose security vulnerabilities in
    applications that are not designed to use them. For this reason, the privilege for creating
    symbolic links should only be assigned to trusted users. By default, only Administrators can
    create symbolic links.

    This policy setting determines whether a domain member can periodically change its computer
    account password. Computers that cannot automatically change their account passwords are
    potentially vulnerable, because an attacker might be able to determine the password for the
    system's domain account.
    The default configuration for Windows Server 2003-based computers that belong to a domain is
    that they are automatically required to change the passwords for their accounts every 30 days.
    If you disable this policy setting, computers that run Windows Server 2003 will retain the same
    passwords as their computer accounts. Computers that are no longer able to automatically change
    their account password are at risk from an attacker who could determine the password for the
    computer's domain account.

    This policy setting determines the maximum allowable age for a computer account password. By
    default, domain members automatically change their domain passwords every 30 days. If you
    increase this interval significantly so that the computers no longer change their passwords, an
    attacker would have more time to undertake a brute force attack against one of the computer
    accounts.
    In Active Directory-based domains, each computer has an account and password just like every
    user. By default, the domain members automatically change their domain password every 30 days.
    If you increase this interval significantly, or set it to 0 so that the computers no longer
    change their passwords, an attacker will have more time to undertake a brute force attack to
    guess the password of one or more computer accounts.

    When this policy setting is enabled, a secure channel can only be established with Domain
    Controllers that are capable of encrypting secure channel data with a strong (128-bit) session
    key. To enable this policy setting, all Domain Controllers in the domain must be able to encrypt
    secure channel data with a strong key, which means all Domain Controllers must be running
    Microsoft Windows 2000 or newer.

    Session keys that are used to establish secure channel communications between Domain Controllers
    and member computers are much stronger in Windows 2000 than they were in previous Microsoft
    operating systems. Whenever possible, you should take advantage of these stronger session keys
    to help protect secure channel communications from attacks that attempt to hijack network
    sessions and eavesdropping. (Eavesdropping is a form of hacking in which network data is read or
    altered in transit. The data can be modified to hide or change the sender, or be redirected.)

  platforms: win10
  platform: windows
  description: |
    This policy setting controls how the RPC server runtime handles unauthenticated RPC clients connecting to RPC servers.
    This policy setting impacts all RPC applications. In a domain environment this policy setting should be used with caution as it can impact a wide range of functionality including group policy processing itself. Reverting a change to this policy setting can require manual intervention on each affected machine. This policy setting should never be applied to a Domain Controller.
    A client will be considered an authenticated client if it uses a named pipe to communicate with the server or if it uses RPC Security. RPC Interfaces that have specifically requested to be accessible by unauthenticated clients may be exempt from this restriction, depending on the selected value for this policy setting.
    -- "None" allows all RPC clients to connect to RPC Servers running on the machine on which the policy setting is applied.
    -- "Authenticated" allows only authenticated RPC Clients (per the definition above) to connect to RPC Servers running on the machine on which the policy setting is applied. Exemptions are granted to interfaces that have requested them.
    -- "Authenticated without exceptions" allows only authenticated RPC Clients (per the definition above) to connect to RPC Servers running on the machine on which the policy setting is applied. No exceptions are allowed. This value has the potential to cause serious problems and is not recommended.
    Note: This policy setting will not be applied until the system is rebooted.
