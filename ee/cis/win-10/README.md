### Limitations

> None. All items in this version of the benchmark are able to be automated.


### Checks that require a Group Policy template

Several items require Group Policy templates in place in order to audit them.
These items are tagged with the label `CIS_group_policy_template_required` in the YAML file, and details about the required Group Policy templates can be found in each item's `resolution`.
