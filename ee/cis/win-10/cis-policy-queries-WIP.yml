    CIS - Ensure 'Prevent users from sharing files within their profile.' is set to 'Enabled'
  platforms: win10
  platform: windows
  description: |
    This policy setting determines whether users can share files within their profile. By default, users are allowed to share files within their profile to other users on their network after an administrator opts in the computer. An administrator can opt in the computer by using the sharing wizard to share a file within their profile.
  resolution: |
    To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to Enabled:
    'User Configuration\Policies\Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Network Sharing\Prevent users from sharing files within their profile'
    Note: This Group Policy path is provided by the Group Policy template Sharing.admx/adml that is included with all versions of the Microsoft Windows Administrative Templates.
