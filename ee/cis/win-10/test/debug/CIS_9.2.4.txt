Expected scenario
==================
1) Open "Edit Group Policy" tool and set the following UI path to 'No':
'Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security\Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security - Local Group Policy Object\Windows Defender Firewall Properties\Private Profile\Settings Customize\Display a notification'

2) After running the policy check, it should return 1 indicating that setting was properly set



Failure scenario
==================
1) Open "Edit Group Policy" tool and set the following UI path to values different than 'No':
'Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security\Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security - Local Group Policy Object\Windows Defender Firewall Properties\Private Profile\Settings Customize\Display a notification'

2) After running the policy check, it should return nothing, indicating that setting was set to a non-compliant value

TODO
==================
Figure out why changing the setting for this does not update the data from 1 to 0

Notes
==================
The path does not exist in the registry until configured
However, once configured, the database is not showing changes to data (from 1 to 0 when set from Yes or No)
