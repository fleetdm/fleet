Failure scenario
==================
1) Open "Edit Group Policy" tool and set the following UI path to values different than '%SystemRoot%\System32\logfiles\firewall\privatefw.log':
'Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security\Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security - Local Group Policy Object\Windows Defender Firewall Properties\Private Profile\Logging Customize\Name'

TODO
==================
Figure out why HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\WindowsFirewall\PrivateProfile\\Logging is not showing up in the registry

Notes
==================
The path does not exist in the registry even after configured: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\WindowsFirewall\PrivateProfile\\Logging
