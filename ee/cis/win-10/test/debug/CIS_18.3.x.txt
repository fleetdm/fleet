Expected scenario
==================
1) Open "Edit Group Policy" tool and set the following UI path to 'Enabled':
'Computer Configuration\Policies\Administrative Templates\MS Security Guide\Apply UAC restrictions to local accounts on network logons'

2) After running the policy check, it should return 1 indicating that setting was properly set



Failure scenario
==================
1) Open "Edit Group Policy" tool and set the following UI path to values different than 'Enabled':
'Computer Configuration\Policies\Administrative Templates\MS Security Guide\Apply UAC restrictions to local accounts on network logons'

2) After running the policy check, it should return nothing, indicating that setting was set to a non-compliant value


TODO
==================
Figure out why there is no \MS Security Guide\ directory and no matching settings for all 18.3.x.
