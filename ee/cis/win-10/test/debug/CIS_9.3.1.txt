Expected scenario
==================
1) Open "Edit Group Policy" tool and set the following UI path to 'On (recommended)':
'Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security\Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security - Local Group Policy Object\Windows Defender Firewall Properties\Public Profile\Firewall state'

2) After running the policy check, it should return 1 indicating that setting was properly set



Failure scenario
==================
1) Open "Edit Group Policy" tool and set the following UI path to values different than 'On (recommended)':
'Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security\Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security - Local Group Policy Object\Windows Defender Firewall Properties\Public Profile\Firewall state'

2) After running the policy check, it should return nothing, indicating that setting was set to a non-compliant value

TODO
==================
Figure out why HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\WindowsFirewall\PublicProfile is not showing up in the registry

Notes
==================
The path 'PublicProfile' does not exist in the registry even after configured (Even though path 'PrivateProfile' does exist)
