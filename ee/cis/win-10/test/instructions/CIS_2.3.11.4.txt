Expected scenario
==================
1) Open "Edit Group Policy" tool and set the following UI path to 'AES128_HMAC_SHA1 AND AES256_HMAC_SHA1 AND Future encryption types':
'Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\Security Options\Network security: Configure encryption types allowed for Kerberos'

2) After running the policy check, it should return 1 indicating that setting was properly set



Failure scenario
==================
1) Open "Edit Group Policy" tool and set the following UI path to values different than 'AES128_HMAC_SHA1 AND AES256_HMAC_SHA1 AND Future encryption types':
'Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\Security Options\Network security: Configure encryption types allowed for Kerberos'

2) After running the policy check, it should return nothing, indicating that setting was set to a non-compliant value
