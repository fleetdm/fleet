  name: CIS - Ensure 'Account lockout duration' is set to '15 or more minute(s)'
  platforms: win11
  platform: windows
  description: |
    This policy setting determines the length of time that must pass before a locked account is unlocked and a user can try to log on again. The setting does this by specifying the number of minutes a locked out account will remain unavailable. If the value for this policy setting is configured to 0, locked out accounts will remain locked out until an administrator manually unlocks them.
    Although it might seem like a good idea to configure the value for this policy setting to a high value, such a configuration will likely increase the number of calls that the help desk receives to unlock accounts locked by mistake. Users should be aware of the length of time a lock remains in place, so that they realize they only need to call the help desk if they have an extremely urgent need to regain access to their computer.
    The recommended state for this setting is: 15 or more minute(s).
    Note: Password Policy settings (section 1.1) and Account Lockout Policy settings (section 1.2) must be applied via the Default Domain Policy GPO in order to be globally in effect on domain user accounts as their default behavior. If these settings are configured in another GPO, they will only affect local user accounts on the computers that receive the GPO. However, custom exceptions to the default password policy and account lockout policy rules for specific domain users and/or groups can be defined using Password Settings Objects (PSOs), which are completely separate from Group Policy and most easily configured using Active Directory Administrative Center.

  platforms: win11
  platform: windows
  description: |
    This policy setting determines the length of time before the Account lockout threshold resets to zero. The default value for this policy setting is Not Defined. If the Account lockout threshold is defined, this reset time must be less than or equal to the value for the Account lockout duration setting.
    If you leave this policy setting at its default value or configure the value to an interval that is too long, your environment could be vulnerable to a DoS attack. An attacker could maliciously perform a number of failed logon attempts on all users in the organization, which will lock out their accounts. If no policy were determined to reset the account lockout, it would be a manual task for administrators. Conversely, if a reasonable time value is configured for this policy setting, users would be locked out for a set period until all of the accounts are unlocked automatically.
    The recommended state for this setting is: 15 or more minute(s).
    Note: Password Policy settings (section 1.1) and Account Lockout Policy settings (section 1.2) must be applied via the Default Domain Policy GPO in order to be globally in effect on domain user accounts as their default behavior.

    This policy setting determines which users or groups have the right to log on as a Remote Desktop Services client. If your organization uses Remote Assistance as part of its help desk strategy, create a group and assign it this user right through Group Policy. If the help desk in your organization does not use Remote Assistance, assign this user right only to the Administrators group or use the Restricted Groups feature to ensure that no user accounts are part of the Remote Desktop Users group.
    Restrict this user right to the Administrators group, and possibly the Remote Desktop Users group, to prevent unwanted users from gaining access to computers on your network by means of the Remote Assistance feature.
    The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators, Remote Desktop Users. Note: The above list is to be treated as a whitelist, which implies that the above
    principals need not be present for assessment of this recommendation to pass.
    Note #2: In all versions of Windows prior to Windows 7, Remote Desktop Services was known as Terminal Services, so you should substitute the older term if comparing against an older OS.

  description: |
    This policy setting determines which users can create symbolic links. In Windows Vista, existing
    NTFS file system objects, such as files and folders, can be accessed by referring to a new kind
    of file system object called a symbolic link. A symbolic link is a pointer (much like a shortcut
    or .lnk file) to another file system object, which can be a file, folder, shortcut or another
    symbolic link. The difference between a shortcut and a symbolic link is that a shortcut only
    works from within the Windows shell. To other programs and applications, shortcuts are just
    another file, whereas with symbolic links, the concept of a shortcut is implemented as a feature
    of the NTFS file system. Symbolic links can potentially expose security vulnerabilities in
    applications that are not designed to use them. For this reason, the privilege for creating
    symbolic links should only be assigned to trusted users. By default, only Administrators can
    create symbolic links.

    If you disable this policy setting, computers that run Windows Server 2003 will retain the same

    and member computers are much stronger in Windows 2000 than they were in previous Microsoft
    operating systems. Whenever possible, you should take advantage of these stronger session keys
    to help protect secure channel communications from attacks that attempt to hijack network
    sessions and eavesdropping. (Eavesdropping is a form of hacking in which network data is read or

    CIS - Ensure 'Network security: Restrict NTLM: Outgoing NTLM traffic to remote servers' is set to 'Audit all' or higher
  platforms: win11
  platform: windows
  description: |
    This policy setting allows the auditing of outgoing NTLM traffic. Events for this setting are recorded in the operational event log (e.g. Applications and Services Log\Microsoft\Windows\NTLM).
    The recommended state for this setting is: Audit all. Configuring this setting to Deny All also conforms to the benchmark.
    Note: Configuring this setting to Deny All is more secure, however it could have a negative impact on applications that still require NTLM. Test carefully before implementing the Deny All value
  resolution: |
    To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to Audit all or higher:
    'Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\Security Options\Restrict NTLM: Outgoing NTLM traffic to remote servers'
  query: |

  description: |
    This subcategory reports on the activities of the Internet Protocol security (IPsec) driver. Events for this subcategory include:
    -  4960: IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed an integrity check. If this problem persists, it could indicate a network issue or that packets are being modified in transit to this computer. Verify that the packets sent from the remote computer are the same as those received by this computer. This error might also indicate interoperability problems with other IPsec implementations.
    -  4961: IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed a replay check. If this problem persists, it could indicate a replay attack against this computer.
    -  4962: IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed a replay check. The inbound packet had too low a sequence number to ensure it was not a replay.
    -  4963: IPsec dropped an inbound clear text packet that should have been secured. This is usually due to the remote computer changing its IPsec policy without informing this computer. This could also be a spoofing attack attempt.
    -  4965: IPsec received a packet from a remote computer with an incorrect Security Parameter Index (SPI). This is usually caused by malfunctioning hardware that is corrupting packets. If these errors persist, verify that the packets sent from the remote computer are the same as those received by this computer. This error may also indicate interoperability problems with other IPsec implementations. In that case, if connectivity is not impeded, then these events can be ignored.
    -  5478: IPsec Services has started successfully.
    -  5479: IPsec Services has been shut down successfully. The shutdown of IPsec Services can put the computer at greater risk of network attack or expose the computer to potential security risks.
    -  5480: IPsec Services failed to get the complete list of network interfaces on the computer. This poses a potential security risk because some of the network interfaces may not get the protection provided by the applied IPsec filters. Use the IP Security Monitor snap-in to diagnose the problem.
    -  5483: IPsec Services failed to initialize RPC server. IPsec Services could not be started.
    -  5484: IPsec Services has experienced a critical failure and has been shut down. The shutdown of IPsec Services can put the computer at greater risk of network attack or expose the computer to potential security risks.
    -  5485: IPsec Services failed to process some IPsec filters on a plug-and-play event for network interfaces. This poses a potential security risk because some of the network interfaces may not get the protection provided by the applied IPsec filters. Use the IP Security Monitor snap-in to diagnose the problem.

    CIS - Ensure LAPS AdmPwd GPO Extension / CSE is installed
  platforms: win11
  platform: windows
  description: |
    In May 2015, Microsoft released the Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS) tool, which is free and supported software that allows an organization to automatically set randomized and unique local Administrator account passwords on domain-attached workstations and Member Servers. The passwords are stored in a confidential attribute of the domain computer account and can be retrieved from Active Directory by approved Sysadmins when needed.
    The LAPS tool requires a small Active Directory Schema update in order to implement, as well as installation of a Group Policy Client Side Extension (CSE) on targeted computers. Please see the LAPS documentation for details.
    LAPS supports Windows Vista or newer workstation OSes, and Server 2003 or newer server OSes. LAPS does not support standalone computers - they must be joined to a domain.
    Note #1: Organizations that utilize 3rd-party commercial software to manage unique & complex local Administrator passwords on domain members may opt to disregard these LAPS recommendations.
    Note #2: LAPS is only designed to manage local Administrator passwords, and is therefore not recommended (or supported) for use directly on Domain Controllers, which do not have a traditional local Administrator account. We strongly encourage you to only deploy the LAPS CSE and LAPS GPO settings to member servers and workstations.
  resolution: |
    In order to utilize LAPS, a minor Active Directory Schema update is required, and a Group Policy Client Side Extension (CSE) must be installed on each managed computer. When LAPS is installed, the file AdmPwd.dll must be present in the following location and registered in Windows (the LAPS AdmPwd GPO Extension / CSE installation does this for you):
    C:\Program Files\LAPS\CSE\AdmPwd.dll

    CIS - Ensure 'Apply UAC restrictions to local accounts on network logons' is set to 'Enabled'
  platforms: win11
  platform: windows
  description: |
    This setting controls whether local accounts can be used for remote administration via network logon (e.g., NET USE, connecting to C$, etc.). Local accounts are at high risk for credential theft when the same account and password is configured on multiple systems. Enabling this policy significantly reduces that risk.
    Enabled: Applies UAC token-filtering to local accounts on network logons. Membership in powerful group such as Administrators is disabled and powerful privileges are removed from the resulting access token. This configures the LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy registry value to 0. This is the default behavior for Windows.
    Disabled: Allows local accounts to have full administrative rights when authenticating via network logon, by configuring the LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy registry value to 1.
    For more information about local accounts and credential theft, review the "Mitigating Pass-the-Hash (PtH) Attacks and Other Credential Theft Techniques" documents.
    For more information about LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy, see Microsoft Knowledge Base article 951016: Description of User Account Control and remote restrictions in Windows Vista.

  description: |
    This policy setting enables Hardware-enforced Stack Protection for kernel-mode code. Kernel-mode data stacks are hardened with hardware-based shadow stacks, which store intended return address targets to ensure that program control flow is not tampered. The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Enabled in enforcement mode.
    
    Note: Virtualization Based Security (VBS) requires a 64-bit version of Windows with Secure Boot enabled, which in turn requires that Windows was installed with a UEFI BIOS configuration, not a Legacy BIOS configuration. In addition, if running Windows on a virtual machine, the hardware-assisted CPU virtualization feature (Intel VT-x or AMD- V) must be exposed by the host to the guest VM. More information on system requirements for this feature can be found at Windows Defender Credential Guard Requirements (Windows 10) | Microsoft Docs
    Note #2: This specific security feature of VBS is only compatible with Windows 11 Release 22H2 (and newer).
    Note #3: Only Intel CPUs from Tiger Lake and beyond or AMD CPUs Zen3 and beyond (both were release in fall 2020) are compatible with this security feature.
    Note #4: Credential Guard and Device Guard are not currently supported when using Azure IaaS VMs.

    CIS - Ensure 'Restrict Unauthenticated RPC clients' is set to 'Enabled: Authenticated'
  platforms: win11
  platform: windows
  description: |
    This policy setting controls how the RPC server runtime handles unauthenticated RPC clients connecting to RPC servers.
    This policy setting impacts all RPC applications. In a domain environment this policy setting should be used with caution as it can impact a wide range of functionality including group policy processing itself. Reverting a change to this policy setting can require manual intervention on each affected machine. This policy setting should never be applied to a Domain Controller.
    A client will be considered an authenticated client if it uses a named pipe to communicate with the server or if it uses RPC Security. RPC Interfaces that have specifically requested to be accessible by unauthenticated clients may be exempt from this restriction, depending on the selected value for this policy setting.
    -- "None" allows all RPC clients to connect to RPC Servers running on the machine on which the policy setting is applied.
    -- "Authenticated" allows only authenticated RPC Clients (per the definition above) to connect to RPC Servers running on the machine on which the policy setting is applied. Exemptions are granted to interfaces that have requested them.
    -- "Authenticated without exceptions" allows only authenticated RPC Clients (per the definition above) to connect to RPC Servers running on the machine on which the policy setting is applied. No exceptions are allowed. This value has the potential to cause serious problems and is not recommended.
    Note: This policy setting will not be applied until the system is rebooted.

    To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to 'Enabled: Authenticated':

Before a Data Recovery Agent can be used it must be added from the Public Key Policies item in either the Group Policy Management Console or the Local Group Policy Editor. Consult the BitLocker Drive Encryption Deployment Guide on Microsoft TechNet for more information about adding Data Recovery Agents.
    In "Configure user storage of BitLocker recovery information" select whether users are allowed, required, or not allowed to generate a 48-digit recovery password or a 256-bit recovery key.
    Select "Omit recovery options from the BitLocker setup wizard" to prevent users from specifying recovery options when they enable BitLocker on a drive. This means that you will not be able to specify which recovery option to use when you enable BitLocker, instead BitLocker recovery options for the drive are determined by the policy setting.
    In "Save BitLocker recovery information to Active Directory Domain Services" choose which BitLocker recovery information to store in AD DS for fixed data drives. If you select "Backup recovery password and key package", both the BitLocker recovery password and key package are stored in AD DS. Storing the key package supports recovering data from a drive that has been physically corrupted. If you select "Backup recovery password only", only the recovery password is stored in AD DS.
    Select the "Do not enable BitLocker until recovery information is stored in AD DS for fixed data drives" check box if you want to prevent users from enabling BitLocker unless the computer is connected to the domain and the backup of BitLocker recovery information to AD DS succeeds.

    This policy setting allows you to manage BitLocker's use of hardware-based encryption on fixed data drives and specify which encryption algorithms it can use with hardware-based encryption. Using hardware-based encryption can improve performance of drive operations that involve frequent reading or writing of data to the drive.
    You can specify additional options that control whether BitLocker software-based encryption is used instead of hardware-based encryption on computers that do not support hardware-based encryption and whether you want to restrict the encryption algorithms and cipher suites used with hardware-based encryption.

    This policy setting allows you to configure whether Secure Boot will be allowed as the platform integrity provider for BitLocker operating system drives. Secure Boot ensures that the PC's pre-boot environment only loads firmware that is digitally signed by authorized software publishers. Secure Boot also provides more flexibility for managing pre-boot configuration than legacy BitLocker integrity checks. Secure Boot requires a system that meets the UEFI 2.3.1 Specifications for Class 2 and Class 3 computers.
    When this policy is enabled and the hardware is capable of using Secure Boot for BitLocker scenarios, the "Use enhanced Boot Configuration Data validation profile" group policy setting is ignored and Secure Boot verifies BCD settings according to the Secure Boot policy setting, which is configured separately from BitLocker.

    This setting controls whether users are permitted to change installation options that typically are available only to system administrators.

If Windows Installer detects that an installation package has permitted the user to change a protected option, it stops the installation and displays a message. These security features operate only when the installation program is running in a privileged security context in which it has access to directories denied to the user.
