  platforms: macOS

  description: |
    The iCloud keychain is Apple's password manager that works with macOS and iOS. The capability allows users to store passwords in either iOS or macOS for use in Safari on both platforms and other iOS-integrated applications. The most pervasive use is driven by iOS use rather than macOS. The passwords stored in a macOS keychain on an Enterprise-managed computer could be stored in Apple's cloud and then be available on a personal computer using the same account. The stored passwords could be for organizational as well as for personal accounts.
    If passwords are no longer being used as organizational tokens, they are not in scope for iCloud keychain storage.
    Rationale:
    Ensure that the iCloud keychain is used consistently with organizational requirements.

  description: |
    In macOS Monterey (12.0), Apple has added the capability to share content from

    ad hoc as required rather than allowing a continuous sharing service. The feature can
    be restricted by Apple ID or network and is configured to use by accepting the

    Starting with 10.13 (macOS High Sierra), Apple introduced a service to make it easier to deploy data from Apple, including software updates, where there are bandwidth constraints to the Internet and fewer constraints or greater bandwidth exist on the local subnet. This capability can be very valuable for organizations that have throttled and possibly metered Internet connections. In heterogeneous enterprise networks with multiple subnets, the effectiveness of this capability would be determined by how many Macs were on each subnet at the time new, large updates were made available upstream. This capability requires the use of mac OS clients as P2P nodes for updated Apple content. Unless there is a business requirement to manage operational Internet connectivity and bandwidth user endpoints should not store content and act as a cluster to provision data.

While there are data spillage concerns with the use of data-gathering personal assistant software, the risk here does not seem greater in sending queries to Apple through Siri than in sending search terms in a browser to Google or Microsoft. While it is possible that Siri will be used for local actions rather than Internet searches, Siri could, in theory, tell Apple about confidential Programs and Projects that should not be revealed. This appears be a usage edge case.
    In cases where sensitive or protected data is processed and Siri could expose that information through assisting a user in navigating their machine, it should be disabled. Siri does need to phone home to Apple, so it should not be available from air-gapped networks as part of its requirements.
    Most of the use case data published has shown that Siri is a tremendous time saver on iOS where multiple screens and menus need to be navigated through. Information like sports scores, weather, movie times, and simple to-do items on existing calendars can be easily found with Siri.

  name: CIS - Ensure Wake for Network Access Is Disabled (Fleetd Required)
  platforms: macOS
  platform: darwin
  description: |
    Wake for Network Access allows the computer to take action when the user is not present and the computer
    is in energy saving mode. These tools require FileVault to remain unlocked and fully rejoin known networks.

    Disabling this feature mitigates the risk of an attacker remotely waking the system and gaining access.

  name: CIS - Ensure the OS is not Activate When Resuming from Sleep (Fleetd, FDA Required)
  platforms: macOS
  platform: darwin
  description: |
    In order to use a computer with Full Disk Encryption (FDE), macOS must keep encryption keys in memory to allow
    the use of the disk that has been FileVault protected. When the system is not in use, the volume is protected
    through encryption. When the system is sleeping and available to quickly resume, the encryption keys remain in memory.
    If an unauthorized party has possession of the computer and the computer is only slept, there are known attack vectors
    that can be attempted against the RAM that has the encryption keys or the running operating system protected
    by a login screen.

    MacBooks should be set so that the `standbydelay` is 15 minutes (900 seconds) or less.
    Mac systems should be set to hibernate after sleeping for a risk-acceptable time period.
    Organizations may still decide to use hibernate after sleeping if there is a security need 
    (ex. international travel), but it can cause kernel panics in Apple Silicon Macs.

    In macOS 14.0 Sonoma, Apple released the ability to limit dictation to staying on-device and not sending data to the Siri severs. The use of dictation is likely to include editing
    documents with confidential information. While Apple does have controls to obfuscate voice data that exists on their servers it is recommended that Dictation collected information does not leave the local Mac.
  resolution: "Ask your system administrator to deploy an MDM profile that enables On-Device Dictation."

    By default, macOS allows all valid users into the top level of every other user's home folder and restricts access to the Apple default folders within. Another user on the same system can see you have a "Documents" folder but cannot see inside it. This configuration does work for personal file sharing but can expose user files to standard accounts on the system.
    The best parallel for Enterprise environments is that everyone who has a Dropbox account can see everything that is at the top level but can't see your pictures. Similarly with macOS, users can see into every new Directory that is created because of the default permissions.
    Home folders should be restricted to access only by the user. Sharing should be used on dedicated servers or cloud instances that are managing access controls. Some environments may encounter problems if execute rights are removed as well as read and write. Either no access or execute only for group or others is acceptable.

    Over time, passwords can be captured by third parties through mistakes, phishing attacks, third-party breaches, or merely brute-force attacks. To reduce the risk of exposure and to decrease the incentives of password reuse (passwords that are not forced to be changed periodically generally are not ever changed), users must reset passwords periodically. This control ensures that previous passwords are not reused immediately by keeping a history of previous password hashes. Ensure that password history checks are part of the password policy on the computer. This control checks whether a new password is different than the previous 15. The latest NIST guidance based on exploit research referenced in this section details how one of the greatest risks is password exposure rather than password cracking. Passwords should be changed to a new unique value whenever a password might have been exposed to anyone other than the account holder. Attackers have maintained persistent control based on predictable password change patterns and substantially different patterns should be used in case of a leak.

    While many people prefer that when they see advertising it is relevant to them and their interests, the detailed

    Attackers use websites with malicious or unwanted content to exploit the user or the computer. Part of the attack chain is to lure someone to load their content rather than the desired content. In order to reduce the risk in interacting with unwanted content the full website address should always be displayed in Safari.

    Graphical Method:
    Perform the following steps to set Safari to show full website addresses:
      1. Open Safari

      4. Select Security
      5. Set Show full website address to enabled
