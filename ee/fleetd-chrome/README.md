# Fleetd Chrome Extension

## Packaging the extension
Generate a .pem file to be the key for the chrome extension.

(In parent dir)
Run the following command to generate an extension.

``` sh
/Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --pack-extension=./fleetd-chrome --pack-extension-key=path/to/chrome.pem
```

## Debugging

### Service worker

View service worker logs in chrome://serviceworker-internals/?devtools (in production), or in chrome://extensions (only during development).

### Manual Enroll

> Steps 1 and 2 can be performed on your workstation. Step 3 and 4 are to be executed on the target Chromebook.

1. Create your .env file:

> IMPORTANT: The address in `FLEET_URL` must have a valid TLS certificate.

```sh
echo 'FLEET_URL="https://your-fleet-server.example.com"' >> .env
echo 'FLEET_ENROLL_SECRET="<your enroll secret>"' >> .env
```

To test with your local Fleet server, you can use ngrok:
```sh
ngrok http https://localhost:8080
```

2. Build the "unpacked extension":
```sh
npm install && npm run build
```
The above command will generate an unpacked extension in `./dist`.

3. Send the `./dist` folder to the target Chromebook.

4. In the target Chromebook, go to `chrome://settings`, toggle `Developer mode` and click on `Load unpacked` and select the `dist` folder.
