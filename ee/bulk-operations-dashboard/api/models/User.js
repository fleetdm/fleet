admin users).  When the email verification feature is enabled, new users created via the
signup form have \`emailStatus: 'unconfirmed'\` until they click the link in the confirmation email.
Similarly, when an existing user changes their email address, they switch to the "change-requested"
email status until they click the link in the confirmation email.`

      extendedDescription:
`Super admins might have extra permissions, see a different default home page when they log in,
or even have a completely different feature set from normal users.  In this app, the \`isSuperAdmin\`
flag is just here as a simple way to represent two different kinds of users.  Usually, it's a good idea
to keep the data model as simple as possible, only adding attributes when you actually need them for
features being built right now.

For example, a "super admin" user for a small to medium-sized e-commerce website might be able to
change prices, deactivate seasonal categories, add new offerings, and view live orders as they come in.
On the other hand, for an e-commerce website like Walmart.com that has undergone years of development
by a large team, those administrative features might be split across a few different roles.

So, while this \`isSuperAdmin\` demarcation might not be the right approach forever, it's a good place to start.`
