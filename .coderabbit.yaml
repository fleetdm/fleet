      instructions: "When reviewing SQL queries that are added or modified, ensure that appropriate filtering criteria are appliedâ€”especially when a query is intended to return data for a specific entity (e.g., a single host). Check for missing WHERE clauses or incorrect filtering that could lead to incorrect or non-deterministic results (e.g., returning the first row instead of the correct one). Flag any queries that may return unintended results due to lack of precise scoping."
