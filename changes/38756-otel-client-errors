Improved OpenTelemetry error handling: client errors (4xx) no longer set span status to Error or appear in the Exceptions tab, following OTEL semantic conventions. Added separate metrics for client vs server errors (`fleet.http.client_errors`, `fleet.http.server_errors`) with error type attribution. Client errors are also no longer sent to APM/Sentry.
