- In maintenance windows using Google Calendar, calendar event is now recreated within 30 seconds if deleted or moved to the past.
  - Fleet server watches for potential changes for up to 1 week after original event time. If event is moved forward more than 1 week, then after 1 week Fleet server will check for event changes once every 30 minutes.
  - These near real-time updates may add additional load to the Google Calendar API, so it is recommended to use API usage alerts or other monitoring methods.
