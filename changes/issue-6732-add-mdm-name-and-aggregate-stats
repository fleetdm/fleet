* Added the _mobile device management_ (MDM) solution name and ID to the `GET /api/v1/fleet/hosts/{id}/macadmins` endpoint, and compute aggregated stats by MDM solution, now returned as part of the `GET /api/v1/fleet/macadmins` endpoint. Note that the MDM solution name and the aggregated stats are updated lazily to prevent a long database migration when upgrading to this Fleet version - the data will be updated as hosts send fresh MDM osquery results to the Fleet instance (typically within an hour or so after upgrading, when using default configuration values).
