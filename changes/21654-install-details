* Ensure details for a software installation run are available and accurate even after the corresponding installer has been edited or deleted

NOTE: The database migration included with this update backfills installer data into installation details based on the currently uploaded installer. To backfill data from activities (which will be more comprehensive and accurate than the migration default, but may take awhile as the entire activities table will be scanned), run this database query _after_ running database migrations:

```sql
UPDATE host_software_installs i
JOIN activities a ON a.activity_type = 'installed_software'
	AND i.execution_id = a.details->>"$.install_uuid"
SET i.software_title_name = COALESCE(a.details->>"$.software_title", i.software_title_name),
	i.installer_filename = COALESCE(a.details->>"$.software_package", i.installer_filename),
	i.updated_at = i.updated_at
```

The above query is optional, and is unnecessary if no software installers have been edited.
