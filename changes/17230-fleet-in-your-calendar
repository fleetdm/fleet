Added integration with Google Calendar.
- Fleet admins can enable Google Calendar integration by using a Google service account with domain-wide delegation.
- Calendar integration is enabled at the team level for specific team policies.
- If the policy is failing, a calendar event will be put on the host user's calendar for the 3rd Tuesday of the month.
- During the event, Fleet will fire a webhook. IT admins should use this webhook to trigger a script or MDM command that will remediate the issue.
