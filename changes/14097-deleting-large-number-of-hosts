Web UI no longer gives an error when deleting a large number of hosts.

After 30 seconds, the 'Delete host' modal closes and the delete operation continues in the background.
The following text has been added to the modal when deleting 500 or more hosts: "When deleting a large volume of hosts, it may take some time for this change to be reflected in the UI."
