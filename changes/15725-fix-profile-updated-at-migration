- Fixed a database migration issue introduced in v4.42.0 that caused Fleet to consider
  previously installed MDM profiles as outdated, which in turn can cause MDM profiles for macOS
  hosts to become stuck in the "failed" state in some cases. Users who have not yet upgraded to
  v4.42.0 should upgrade to v4.43.0 directly. Users who have already upgraded to v4.42.0 and find
  one or more hosts that are affected by this issue can mitigate the issue by directly updating the
  Fleet database with the following SQL statement, which will cause the failed profiles to be
  redelivered to the host:

  ```sql
  UPDATE
    host_mdm_apple_profiles
  SET
    status = NULL,
    retries = 0
  WHERE
    status = 'failed' AND
    (detail = 'Failed, was verifying' OR detail = 'Failed, was verified') AND
    host_uuid = ?;
  ```

  Replace the `?` in the above statement with the UUID of the affected host, which can be found
  by enabling the UUID column of the hosts table in the Fleet UI.
