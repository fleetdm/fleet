- Addressed issue where Orbit repeatedly tries to launch Nudge in the event of a launch error, which
  causes Nudge to steal focus from the user's current application. Instead, Nudge will now be disabled
  if it encounters a launch error. It will remain disabled until Orbit is restarted or the Nudge app
  is updated.
