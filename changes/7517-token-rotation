- Added functionality to consider device tokens as expired after one hour.
  This change is not compatible with older versions of Fleet Desktop, we recommend to manually update Orbit and Fleet Desktop to > v1.0.0 in addition to upgrading the server if:
    - You're managing your own TUF server.
    - Or have auto-updates disabled (`fleetctl package [...] --disable-updates`)
    - Or have channels pinned to an older version (`fleetctl package [...] --orbit-channel 1.0.0 --desktop-channel 1.1.0`)
