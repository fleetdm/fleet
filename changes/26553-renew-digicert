Fleet-managed DigiCert certificates will be renewed 30 days before expiry for those valid longer than 30 days or when half the validity period remains for certificates valid 30 days or less. This only applies to certificates that were initially requested after this feature was added. For hosts with DigiCert certificates originally requested prior to this renew feature, manually resending the profile will generate a new certificate which will be automatically renewed before its next expiry.
