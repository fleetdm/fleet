- Changed the way we performed searches when mapping software to CPEs, by first sanitizing the vendor
  and product name, and then searching for (in this order):

* The vendor and product.
* The product name only.
* Free text search on the 'title' property.

- When performing vulnerability detection using the NVD database, we now exclude software from the
  'rpm' and 'deb' sources (we will be using OVAL for those).
- Fixed bug that caused duplicated vulnerabilities to be sent to third party integrations.
- Moved NVD vulnerability detection to its own directory.
