Fleet-managed NDES certificates will be renewed 30 days before expiry for those valid longer than 30 days or when half the validity period remains for certificates valid 30 days or less. This only applies to certificates that were requested after this renewal feature was added. For hosts with NDES certificates requested prior to this renew feature, updating the profile to contain the $FLEET_VAR_SCEP_RENEWAL_ID variable in the CN and then manually resending the profile will generate a new certificate which will be automatically renewed before its next expiry.
