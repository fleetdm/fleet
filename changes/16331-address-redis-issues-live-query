* Added logging when a Redis connection is blocked for a long time waiting for live query results.
* Added support for the `redis.conn_wait_timeout` configuration setting for Redis standalone (it was previously only supported on Redis cluster).
* Added Redis cleanup of inactive queries in a cron job, so temporary Redis failures to stop a live query doesn't leave such queries around for a long time.
