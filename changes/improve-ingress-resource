Improve ingress resource by replacing the template with a most recent version, that enables:

- Not having any annotation hardcoded, all annotations are optional.
- Custom path, as of now it was hardcoded to `/*`, but depending on the ingress controller, it can require an extra annotation to work with regular expressions.
- Specify ingressClassName, as it was hardcoded to `gce`, and this is a setting that might be different on each cluster.
