Fleet server now supports issuing host identity certificates through SCEP (Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol) that fleetd can use with TPM 2.0 hardware to cryptographically sign all HTTP requests. This hardware-backed authentication provides enterprise-grade security similar to mTLS by ensuring private keys never leave the TPM's secure boundary, establishing cryptographic proof that requests originate from the same physical device that initially enrolled.
