- Added new host detail queries to ingest operating system name, version, architecture, and
  kernel version.
- Updated `GET /os_versions` endpoint to include new request and response fields.
- Updated `GET /hosts` endpoint to add `operating_system_id` query parameter.
- Enhanced UI for host operating systems to include additional information for Windows and macOS.

Note that the operating systems data and the aggregated stats are updated lazily to prevent a long
database migration when upgrading to this Fleet version - the data will be updated as hosts send
fresh osquery results to the Fleet instance. For online hosts this typically occurs within an hour
or so after upgrading, when using default configuration values. Operating system data for offline
hosts will not be available until the host comes back online. Aggregated stats will not include
a host until that host has reported back at least once following the upgrade.
