- DEB and RPM packages generated by `fleetctl package` will now be safe to upgrade in-band through the Software page.
  - Note that the package will need to be updated out-of-band once, because the pre-removal script from previously-generated packages is called upon an upgrade. The old pre-removal script stopped Orbit unconditionally.
  - In other words, fleet-osquery can safely be updated through the Software page only _after_ a new package generated with this version of fleetctl has been installed through other means.
