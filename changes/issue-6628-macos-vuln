* Improved vulnerability detection on MacOS to decrease false positives and added the ability to define custom rules for matching software to CPEs for vulnerability processing.
  When upgrading fleet, there are a few config options to consider or else vulnerability processing will stop working.
  If the environment variable `FLEET_VULNERABILITIES_DISABLE_DATA_SYNC` is set to `true` or the flag `--vulnerabilities_disable_data_sync` is set, you must manually download the latest CPE database and CPE translations files and copy them to the vulnerabilities databases path that has been configured for fleet..
  If the environment variable `FLEET_VULNERABILITIES_CPE_DATABASE_URL` is set or the flag `--vulnerabilities_cpe_database_url` is set, you must ensure that the CPE database file the url points to has been updated to the latest version.
  The latest CPE database and CPE translations files can be downloaded from [NVD Releases](https://github.com/fleetdm/nvd/releases/latest).
