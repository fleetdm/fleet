Have you ever been excited about a shiny, new toy, only to find out it wasn’t as cool as the commercial made it seem?

That’s no fun. At Fleet, our open-source philosophy means [we believe in transparency](https://fleetdm.com/transparency). We could tell you all about what Fleet can do for your organization — from [tracking compliance](https://fleetdm.com/securing/stay-on-course-with-your-security-compliance-goals) to [detecting vulnerabilities](https://fleetdm.com/engineering/linux-vulnerability-detection-with-oval-and-fleet). Or you can play with Fleet yourself. You don’t even have to wait for your birthday.

Introducing Sandbox: The fastest way to start playing with Fleet on your device. It’s simple to set up, easy to use, and totally free.

## Get started in minutes

Instead of asking you to go through extra steps, we set up your Fleet instance on one of our servers. Then it’s as easy as 1-2-3.

1. **Create your account.** Provide an email and password.
2. **Download the installer.** Choose the OS on your device.
3. **Run the package.** Register your device as a host.

That’s all there is to it. If you do run into difficulties, you can easily [create an issue](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug%2C%3Areproduce&template=bug-report.md&title=) or [send a Slack message](https://fleetdm.com/slack). We’ll respond with a solution as quickly as possible.

You’ll have 24 hours to access Fleet Sandbox. We’ll pause your account once your session ends. So, start playing right away! There are a lot of toys to try.

## Test all our queries

Like any good sandbox, you’ll have the freedom to play your way. Do you have a specific question about your workstation? See how easy it is to create custom queries with the Fleet UI.

Maybe you aren’t so comfortable with code. No sweat. Explore the query library. Security specialists and IT administrators from the Fleet community have vetted all these queries. And they all come pre-loaded with Sandbox.

If you don’t have time for a custom setup, Fleet Sandbox comes out of the box with common security policies — providing a snapshot of your device’s security.

## Try it with your team

We’re sure you’ll have fun with Fleet Sandbox. But telling people about your unique experience only goes so far. Sometimes you just had to be there.

That’s why you should share Sandbox with members of your team. No need to create multiple accounts. Just send the installer to a few team members. Since you only have 24 hours to access Sandbox, we suggest sharing it with people who would be active users — so you and your team can make the most of your trial.

Letting members of your team try Sandbox provides a clearer picture of what your workday would look like with Fleet. Plus, you’ll have more people to help you decide whether Fleet is right for your organization.

## See for yourself

Sandbox makes it easy to see what kind of data you can collect with Fleet. From full disk encryption and healthy antivirus software to MDM enrollment and enabled firewalls. Those insights are just from a few of the queries in our library.

You can keep learning about Fleet after your Sandbox session expires. [Join the Fleet community on Slack](https://fleetdm.com/slack) to stay up to date.
