This feature enables the execution of scripts directly from the Host Details page for Windows devices, providing a streamlined and efficient process for script management. By extending script support to Windows, Fleet demonstrates a commitment to openness, catering to a broader user base and acknowledging the diverse environments in which its users operate. This update signifies Fleetâ€™s dedication to ownership, empowering users with robust tools to manage their devices effectively across different operating systems.
