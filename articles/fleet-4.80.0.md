Fleet 4.80.0 is now available. See the complete [changelog](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/releases/tag/fleet-v4.80.0) or read on for highlights. For upgrade instructions, visit the [upgrade guide](https://fleetdm.com/docs/deploying/upgrading-fleet) in the Fleet docs.

## Highlights

- Dedicated devices: Schedule App Store app updates and view location
- Personal devices: Only report managed apps and auto uninstall apps when employees leave
- Deploy in-house and custom iOS/iPadOS apps

### Dedicated devices: Schedule App Store app updates and view location

Now you can [schedule App Store app updates](https://fleetdm.com/guides/install-app-store-apps#schedule-app-updates) on dedicated (ex. Zoom room) iOS and iPadOS devices. This way, updates happen during overnight windows to minimize user disruption. In addition, Fleet now displays the last known location for these devices, making it easier to track down lost or missing hardware. Learn how to [find the location](https://fleetdm.com/guides/lock-wipe-hosts#get-location-of-locked-ios-ipados-host).

### Personal devices: Only report managed apps and auto uninstall apps when employees leave

Fleet now reports only managed (company-deployed) apps on personal (BYO) iOS and iPadOS devices. When a device unenrolls, Fleet automatically removes any company-deployed apps, ensuring your organization’s data doesn’t stay behind on personal devices.

### Deploy in-house and custom iOS/iPadOS apps

Use Fleet to deploy in-house (`.ipa`) apps to iOS and iPadOS devices. You can also deploy custom ([unlisted](https://developer.apple.com/support/unlisted-app-distribution/)) Apple App Store apps, giving you full control over your enterprise software from one place.
