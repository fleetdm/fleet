We have recently had Lares perform penetration testing on our internal instance of Fleet. Lares performed the last test on 4.12. This test unveiled some authorization issues identified in this [advisory](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/security/advisories/GHSA-pr2g-j78h-84cr) and resolved in 4.13.

As promised when we published the [Orbit audit](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/blob/26daf00e5a8ce509371f33065ebf06eecf50c557/docs/files/2021-04-26-orbit-auto-updater-assessment.pdf) and said weâ€™d post other audit and pentest reports, we are now publishing the full report. We resolved the most critical issues in 4.13, and we continue to track and prioritize the others.

Small redacted sections are present in the PDF as we are hiding some internal email addresses to
save ourselves from receiving more spam. 

You can find the full report here: [2022-04-29-fleet-penetration-test.pdf](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/raw/main/docs/files/2022-04-29-fleet-penetration-test.pdf).

You can see all publicly available security audits and penetration testing reports in the Fleet [documentation](https://fleetdm.com/docs/using-fleet/security-audits), including what we intend to do about the remaining issues.
