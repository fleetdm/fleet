### Custom software icons

IT Admins can now add custom icons for software. This makes it easier for end users to visually identify and install the tools they need from self-service. Learn more in the [self-service software guide](https://fleetdm.com/guides/software-self-service).

### Batch script details

A new page gives you a full view of all batch scripts that are scheduled or running. No more hunting for script statuses, output, and errors across individual hosts' **Host details** pages. Now it’s all in one place. Learn more in the [scripts guide](https://fleetdm.com/guides/scripts#batch-execute-scripts).

### Linux setup experience

You can now install required software as part of your Linux setup process and show live progress to the end user. This ensures new Linux workstations are ready for day one, with less needing manual setup. Learn more in the [Linux setup experience guide](https://fleetdm.com/guides/windows-linux-setup-experience).

### Self-service software intructions

Fleet now includes default launch instructions for software in the **My device > Self-service** tab. End users get simple tips on how to open installed apps (e.g., “Finder > Applications” on macOS), reducing confusion and helping them get started faster. 

### AWS IAM autnetication for MySQL and Redis

Companies that self-host Fleet can now use IAM (Identity and Access Management) authentication for MySQL and Redis. This lets use short-lived credentials to algin with AWS best practices. Learn how to configure in the [Fleet server configuration reference](https://fleetdm.com/docs/configuration/fleet-server-configuration#mysql).
