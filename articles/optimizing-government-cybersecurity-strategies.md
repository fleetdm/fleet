Government agencies have a never-ending need for better visibility into their network security posture. Fleet Device Management is helping engineers clear a view through the security jungle to focus on what they need.  The “jungle” is a collection of security products implemented to improve security, but over time, it created a massive jungle of technologies few people know how to use to sort for recent and correct data.  Fleet enhances your DevSecOps strategy, helping you navigate the jungle to get near real-time visibility into the threat information you need when you want it.  Use Fleet with DevSecOps and zero-trust process to help clear a path through the security jungle. Engineers need simple and stable tooling: something easy to set up, unbloated, and untainted by the current security jungle.  They want compatible tools that they can deploy gradually yet solve real problems quickly enough to matter. Open-source product that can be customized and automated thoroughly but is still foolproof that all team members can learn to use.

Fleet will improve government agencies' security posture in the following ways:


* Improved visibility and control: Fleet provides a unified view of all endpoints across the network, giving security teams greater visibility into their environment and the ability to identify and respond to threats quickly.
* Enhanced protection: Fleet uses a variety of security technologies to protect endpoints from a wide range of threats, including malware, ransomware, and phishing attacks.
* Proven open-source technology: Fleet uses osquery plus Fleet extensions to pull logs from endpoints and feed them into a detection pipeline or security information event manager (SIEM). Fleet's use of and extensions to osquery (a widely used open-source endpoint data collection tool) adds depth, timeliness, flexibility, and accuracy to other data sources like endpoint detection & response (EDR) and mobile device management (MDM) tools, as written about by Tom Larkin from Snowflake: [Delivering data to Snowflake from Fleet and osquery.](https://fleetdm.com/guides/delivering-data-to-snowflake-from-fleet-and-osquery)
* Simplified compliance: Fleet can help agencies comply with many security regulations, including the [Federal Information Security Modernization Act](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/cyber-threats-and-advisories/federal-information-security-modernization-act) (FISMA) and [National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity frameworks](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework/updating-nist-cybersecurity-framework-journey-csf-20).

Here are some specific examples of how Fleet can improve government agencies' security posture:


* Help detect malicious activity on endpoints, including malware, ransomware, and phishing attacks. 
* Prevent unauthorized access: Fleet can be integrated with identity provider (IDP) platforms to implement device trust use cases and other security measures to prevent unauthorized access to endpoints.
* Enforce security policies: Fleet can be used to enforce security policies, such as password requirements and patch management policies, across all endpoints.
* Monitor for suspicious activity: Fleet can be used to monitor endpoints for suspicious activity, such as unusual network traffic or changes to system files.
* Respond to security incidents: Fleet can collect forensic data and isolate infected devices through automation for security incident response.

Fleet is a robust endpoint security platform that can help the DoD improve its security posture and protect its systems from a wide range of threats.

In addition to the above, Fleet will also help agencies improve security posture by:


* Reduce the attack surface: Fleet can be used to reduce the attack surface of agency networks by identifying and remediating vulnerabilities.
* Prioritize: Fleet can help prioritize vulnerabilities by decorating Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) with common vulnerability scoring system (CVSS) scores, exploit prediction scoring system (EPSS), and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) known exploit vulnerabilities (KEV) and providing filtering and sorting dashboards to enable remediation workflows.
* Improve cyber hygiene: Fleet can improve the cyber hygiene of the agency's workforce by providing security awareness training and enforcing security best practices.
* Enhance incident response: Fleet can enhance incident response capabilities by providing near real-time visibility into endpoints and the ability to take action to contain and mitigate threats quickly.

In the intricate and ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity, Fleet stands as a pivotal tool for government agencies, offering a beacon of clarity and control amidst the complexities of network security management. By harnessing the robust capabilities of Fleet, agencies are empowered to navigate through the dense thicket of cyber threats with unprecedented precision and foresight.

At its core, Fleet transforms the challenge of endpoint security into an opportunity for strategic defense. It offers a unified view across the network, enhancing visibility and control and enabling security teams to detect and respond to threats with remarkable speed and efficiency. Its comprehensive approach to protection, leveraging the power of osquery and its extensions, arms agencies against a diverse array of cyber threats, from malware to sophisticated phishing attacks.

Beyond mere defense, Fleet elevates the standards of compliance, aligning with critical regulations like FISMA and the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, thus fortifying the trust and integrity essential to government operations. The platform’s ability to detect malicious activity, enforce stringent security policies, and facilitate rapid incident response positions it as a cornerstone in cyber defense architecture.

Fleet's role in enhancing cyber hygiene, reducing the attack surface, and prioritizing vulnerabilities further cements its position as an indispensable asset. By offering near real-time insights and a framework for proactive threat mitigation, Fleet defends and educates, guiding agencies toward a more secure and resilient digital future.

In the grand scheme of government cybersecurity, Fleet emerges not just as a solution but as a strategic partner, reshaping the approach to digital security in a landscape fraught with challenges. Its implementation signifies a step towards a more secure, controlled, and resilient digital environment, safeguarding the nation's data and digital infrastructure against the ever-growing spectrum of cyber threats.
