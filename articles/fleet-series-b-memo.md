# How Fleet raised a $27M Series B - without a pitch deck

When Mike decided to raise Fleet’s Series B, he didn’t make a pitch deck.  
He wrote a memo instead.

That memo laid out what’s happening in the market, how Fleet is growing, and what we want to build next. It helped us raise $27 million from investors who understand open source, infrastructure, and long-term bets.

Today, we’re excited to share our version of that memo publicly.

Fleet is now used to manage millions of laptops and servers across organizations of all sizes. From startups to large enterprises, and anyone in between. Our customers run it on-prem, in the cloud, or behind locked doors. The use cases keep expanding, but the core idea stays the same: give managers and teams a fast, open way to understand and control their devices.

We’ve grown steadily by focusing on what real IT and security teams need—not what’s trendy. This round isn’t about changing direction. It’s about doubling down.

> *“We didn’t raise this round to change our strategy. We raised it to keep doing what’s working.”*  
> *— Mike McNeil, CEO of Fleet*


## What’s next

This funding lets us keep investing in:

- making the open source version better for real-world use  
- building features for large-scale and air-gapped environments  
- making it easier to manage devices across platforms, clouds, and networks

We’re hiring. We’re listening. And we’re shipping fast.

If you’re already using Fleet: thank you.  
If you’re just getting curious: this memo is a good place to start.
