## Scaling IT-as-a-Service with GitOps-first management

As an "IT-as-a-Service" provider, managing over 8,000 laptops across 120 SME customers, they needed a centralized, multi-tenant solution that prioritized automation and GitOps workflows.

## At a glance

- **Endpoints:** 8,000+ laptops across 120 customers.  
- **Primary Requirement:** GitOps-first infrastructure and multi-tenancy.  
- **Key Integrations:** GitOps, Multi-MDM connections per customer.  
- **Previous Solution:** ManageEngine.  

## The Challenge: Scaling manual processes

Before Fleet, they used ManageEngine, but found it difficult to automate and scale application management for their diverse client base. Linux servers and remote laptops were "blind spots" where they lacked necessary granular visibility and control.

## The Solution: Unified GitOps and Transparency

They chose Fleet for its ability to support Mac, Windows, and Linux from a single interface while integrating deeply with automated workflows. The open-source transparency allowed them to audit and adjust agent flows to meet specific security standards.

## The Results: Efficiency and Cost Avoidance

- **Cost Savings:** The migration allowed them to avoid renewing 3,000+ ManageEngine licenses, resulting in significant cost avoidance.  
- **Automated Deployments:** Using GitOps labels, they automated the assignment of policies and scripts across thousands of devices.  
- **Operational Clarity:** Exposing device info transparently built trust with their customers' employees and improved troubleshooting speed.
