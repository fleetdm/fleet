# Modular workspace software company

## Strengthening security posture with configuration-as-code

A modular, connected workspace provider manages a diverse fleet of over 1,400 active hosts. They sought to eliminate management complexity and establish a single point of truth.

## At a glance

- **Endpoints:** 1,465 (Mac, Windows, Mobile, Linux).  
- **Primary requirement:** GitOps workflow integration and osquery capabilities.  
- **Key integrations:** GitOps, Mobile management.  
- **Previous solution:** Kandji and Intune.  

## The challenge: siloed workflows

Juggling Kandji and Intune led to siloed workflows and limited control over Windows and mobile platforms. Linux servers and newer platforms like VisionOS were significant blind spots.

## The solution: transparent security

They chose Fleet for its ability to manage device configurations with the same version-control rigor as their codebase. Transparency helps employees understand the "why" behind management practices, building deeper trust.

## The results: proactive auditing

- **Automated naming:** using GitOps-integrated API calls, they automated software deployment, policy enforcement, and device naming.  
- **Eliminating sprawl:** consolidating multiple vendors into Fleet reduced overlapping licensing fees.  
- **Real-time detection:** the team can immediately detect failed policies or missing updates, strengthening their auditing capabilities.
