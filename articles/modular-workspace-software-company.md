# Modular workspace software company

## Strengthening security posture with configuration-as-code

A modular, connected workspace provider manages a diverse fleet of over 1,400 active hosts. They sought to eliminate management complexity and establish a single point of truth.

## At a glance

- **Endpoints:** 1,465 (Mac, Windows, Mobile, Linux).  
- **Primary Requirement:** GitOps workflow integration and osquery capabilities.  
- **Key Integrations:** GitOps, Mobile management.  
- **Previous Solution:** Kandji and Intune.  

## The Challenge: Siloed Workflows

Juggling Kandji and Intune led to siloed workflows and limited control over Windows and mobile platforms. Linux servers and newer platforms like VisionOS were significant blind spots.

## The Solution: Transparent Security

They chose Fleet for its ability to manage device configurations with the same version-control rigor as their codebase. Transparency helps employees understand the "why" behind management practices, building deeper trust.

## The Results: Proactive Auditing

- **Automated Naming:** Using GitOps-integrated API calls, they automated software deployment, policy enforcement, and device naming.  
- **Eliminating Sprawl:** Consolidating multiple vendors into Fleet reduced overlapping licensing fees.  
- **Real-time Detection:** The team can immediately detect failed policies or missing updates, strengthening their auditing capabilities.
