In a secure government office, a team of cybersecurity experts monitors a network sprawling across thousands of devices - each a node in a complex web of national security. Their task is daunting: safeguard these digital assets against ever-evolving cyber threats. It's a digital battlefield where visibility and quick response are their best defense. This is the environment where Axonius, coupled with Fleet Device Management powered by osquery, shines as a beacon of innovation and security.

Amid this high-stakes scenario, Axonius emerges as a cornerstone of asset management and security orchestration. Combined with Fleet Device Management, it is not just an enhancement; it's a transformational shift in managing federal cybersecurity.


Fleet, already a trusted tool in organizations like Fastly, brings a suite of functionalities to the Axonius platform. With Axonius providing a comprehensive asset inventory, Fleet elevates this to a new level of security proficiency:


* **Enhanced Vulnerability Reporting and Management:** By leveraging osquery-based discovery of all software items on devices and comparing that inventory to the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) and other sources, Fleet provides advanced vulnerability reporting capabilities. Federal agencies can detect and prioritize vulnerabilities in near-real-time. Once the scope of the device fleet is known by Axonius, agencies can track the coverage of the osquery agent used by Fleet to track improvement to overall security posture.
* **Streamlined Device Management (MDM):** Fleet allows organizations to manage their fleet of devices efficiently. With Axonius’s device inventory, MDM enrollment can be tracked accurately, ensuring agencies maximize centralized control over their devices, ensuring proper configurations, secure access, and compliance with security policies.
* **Comprehensive Device Health Monitoring:** Ensuring the health and performance of devices is vital for federal agencies. Fleet monitors the health of devices in real-time, enabling agencies to address issues promptly and minimize security risks.
* **Granular Posture-Based Access Control:** Integrating Fleet's posture-based access control features with Axonius can help agencies enforce security policies dynamically. Devices that meet predefined security standards can gain access, while non-compliant devices are isolated, reducing the attack surface.
* **Optimized Software License Management:** Fleet can identify unused or underutilized software licenses, helping agencies optimize their software assets and reduce costs. When shared with Axonius, this data can be used to track license usage and ensure compliance with software agreements alongside Axonius's other inventory tracking capabilities.


Leveraging the open-source power of osquery, Fleet bolsters Axonius’s agency customers to advance threat detection:


* **Real-Time Endpoint Visibility:** osquery transforms endpoints into an SQL database, allowing agencies to query endpoints in real time for critical data on system configurations, processes, and user activities. This valuable information can enhance Axonius’s comprehensive asset inventory.
* **Robust Threat Detection:** osquery offers a robust mechanism for detecting threats and anomalies across the endpoint environment. By sharing this data with Axonius, federal agencies can correlate threat information with asset details, facilitating rapid threat response and mitigation.
* **Accelerated Incident Response:** Using osquery alongside Axonius empowers federal agencies to enhance their incident response capabilities. Security teams can swiftly identify compromised endpoints, isolate them, and initiate remediation actions.


In the intricate and ever-shifting world of federal cybersecurity, where teams of experts vigilantly guard a network of countless devices, the combination of Axonius with Fleet emerges as a pivotal force. This alliance is not just about enhancing capabilities; it represents a significant leap in how cybersecurity is managed at the federal level.

With Fleet's robust functionality and Axonius's comprehensive asset management, this partnership extends beyond mere technological advancement. It embodies a strategic shield intricately woven to protect the nation's digital infrastructure against the relentless tide of cyber threats. In this challenging digital battlefield, where clarity and rapid response are paramount, Axonius and Fleet stand as crucial allies, offering a blend of visibility, precision, and agility critical for safeguarding national security interests.
