# Secureframe adopts Fleet as its default agent for security compliance

**Big news:** [Secureframe](https://secureframe.com), a leader in compliance automation, has adopted [Fleet](https://fleetdm.com) as the default agent on their platform.

This move brings open-source device visibility and control to thousands of Secureframe customers, including teams at **AngelList, Generali, Rand McNally**, and **Coda**. It’s a win for companies that want to simplify security and compliance at scale — without sacrificing transparency.

    <p>“We chose Fleet because it is lightning fast and supports every computing platform,” said Shrav Mehta, CEO at Secureframe. “It gives security teams the access we need to do our jobs, while still giving employees complete visibility into what code is running on their computers.”</p>

## Why open source matters

Fleet is built on osquery, an open-source project created by Fleet co-founder Zach Wasserman. By using open tools, Secureframe helps customers avoid black-box software and instead gives them confidence in what’s running on their devices.

    <p>“I was stoked to see the Fleet logo on my laptop," said Thomas Buley, CEO at Sightglass and a Secureframe customer.  "It's great to know the code that's running on our computers is open-source, and that it's the same code that folks like Stripe are using."</p>

Fleet’s open design means teams can audit and verify exactly what the agent is doing. That builds trust with employees, auditors, and security teams — especially when compliance is a must-have for winning customers or expanding globally.

## Built to scale with growing companies

Secureframe’s platform, powered by Fleet, gives teams a scalable way to automate compliance across every major desktop OS: **macOS, Windows, and Linux**.

Fleet’s flexible design supports:

- ✅ Real-time and deferred device data collection via osquery  
- ✅ Remote configuration and enforcement of security controls  
- ✅ Disk encryption with FileVault, BitLocker, and LUKS  
- ✅ Support for desktop Linux, Apple MDM, and Windows Autopilot  
- ✅ Application installs, automated enrollment, and remote lock  

As companies grow, their environments become more complex — multiple teams, new geographies, different device types, and even acquired subsidiaries with their own tooling. Secureframe, with Fleet, can support it all.

    <p>“When companies grow, the growth can happen very suddenly,” said Mike McNeil, CEO at Fleet.  “Secureframe gives companies the immediate compliance wins they need to run their business, while future-proofing the next chapter of their growth so they don't have to rebuild everything from scratch.”</p>
