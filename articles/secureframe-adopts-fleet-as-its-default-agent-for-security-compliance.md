# Secureframe adopts Fleet as its default agent for security compliance

**Big news:** [Secureframe](https://secureframe.com), a leader in compliance automation, has adopted [Fleet](https://fleetdm.com) as the **default agent** on their platform.

This move brings open-source device visibility and control to thousands of Secureframe customers, including teams at **AngelList, Generali, Rand McNally**, and **Coda**. It’s a win for companies that want to simplify security and compliance at scale — without sacrificing transparency.

> _“We chose Fleet because it is lightning fast and supports every computing platform,”_  
> said **Shrav Mehta**, CEO at Secureframe.  
> _“It gives security teams the access we need to do our jobs, while still giving employees complete visibility into what code is running on their computers.”_

## Why open source matters

Fleet is built on **osquery**, an open-source project created by Fleet co-founder **Zach Wasserman**. By using open tools, Secureframe helps customers avoid black-box software and instead gives them confidence in what’s running on their devices.

> _“I was stoked to see the Fleet logo on my laptop,”_  
> said **Thomas Buley**, CEO at Sightglass and a Secureframe customer.  
> _“It's great to know the code that's running on our computers is open-source, and that it's the same code that folks like Stripe are using.”_

Fleet’s open design means teams can **audit and verify** exactly what the agent is doing. That builds trust with employees, auditors, and security teams — especially when compliance is a must-have for **winning customers or expanding globally**.

## Built to scale with growing companies

Secureframe’s updated platform, powered by Fleet, gives teams a **scalable** way to automate compliance across every major OS: **macOS, Windows, and Linux**.

Fleet’s flexible design supports:

- ✅ Real-time and deferred device data collection via osquery  
- ✅ Remote configuration and enforcement of security controls  
- ✅ Disk encryption with FileVault, BitLocker, and LUKS  
- ✅ Support for desktop Linux, Apple MDM, and Windows Autopilot  
- ✅ Application installs, automated enrollment, and remote lock  

As companies grow, their environments become more complex — multiple teams, new geographies, different device types, and even acquired subsidiaries with their own tooling. Secureframe, with Fleet, can support it all.

> _“When companies grow, the growth can happen very suddenly,”_  
> said **Mike McNeil**, CEO at Fleet.  
> _“Secureframe gives companies the immediate compliance wins they need to run their business, while future-proofing the next chapter of their growth so they don't have to rebuild everything from scratch.”_

This partnership reflects a shared belief:  
**Security and compliance work better when they’re built on openness, transparency, and tools people can actually trust.**
