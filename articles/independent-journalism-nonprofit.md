# Independent journalism nonprofit

## Managing journalism infrastructure with modern DevOps

An independent journalism nonprofit builds infrastructure for independent journalism and manages a remote-first fleet of macOS and Linux devices. They required a developer-centric tool that aligned with their open-source values.

## At a glance

- **Endpoints:** ~39 (Mac and Linux).  
- **Primary Requirement:** Open-source core and GitOps capabilities.  
- **Key Integrations:** osquery, internal team dashboards.  
- **Previous Solution:** Traditional "black-box" MDMs.  

## The Challenge: Value Misalignment

Traditional MDMs felt like "black boxes" that were misaligned with their mission. They specifically struggled with maintaining consistent visibility into Linux workstations.

## The Solution: Declarative Configuration

They chose Fleet for its ability to treat Linux and macOS with equal visibility via osquery. They manage their device state via version-controlled repositories (GitOps), which allows them to stay lean.

## The Results: High-Trust Remote Management

- **Invisible Transition:** The migration was nearly invisible to users, leveraging declarative configurations to managed states without disruption.  
- **Transparent Metrics:** Device compliance status is synced directly to internal team dashboards via the API.  
- **Live Posture Checks:** The team can run live queries across the entire foundation to confirm security status in seconds.
