This week we celebrate our first anniversary since officially releasing the Fleet project under Fleet Device Management — and what a year we’ve had.

## A year at Fleet...

Over the course of a year (and 29 releases), we’ve seen over 2,700 commits to the codebase from 90 contributors. Our all-remote team has grown to 17 fantastic folks, spanning 3 continents, and we’ve been thrilled to see continued adoption of Fleet by leading enterprises, including customers in the Fortune 50.

## Highlights include:

- Introduced global and team scheduling
- Added role-based access control
- Introduced Software Inventory management
- Added auto-updates
- Introduced Orbit, our enhanced osquery agent
- Added policies for verifying device compliance and organizational policies.
- Continued iterative UX enhancements to the Fleet GUI
- Helped users scale Fleet to over 150,000 hosts in a single deployment
- And so much more!

## What's next?

On the road ahead, we plan to continue releasing iterative steps to bring value to our users, and the osquery community, by providing a privacy-friendly, self-service, and open source device management solution. Here’s a little teaser of what’s to come in the months ahead:

- Improvements to vulnerability detection — vulnerable software across all devices and ability to ignore certain vulnerabilities.
- Improvements to the software inventory — last used date, installation date.
- Greater control for team maintainers — ability to manage team members and team specific enrollment secrets.
- Live query API route — make one request to the Fleet API to run queries and receive results for multiple devices.
- More powerful standard query library — import standard policies in Fleet to help users to ask the right questions of their devices, right out of the box.

Thank you for an amazing first year,

Fleet
