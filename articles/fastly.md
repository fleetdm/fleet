# Stripe moved 10,000 Macs to Fleet, saving hundreds of thousands annually

## The Challenge

The Fastly team wanted to consolidate multiple vendors used in managing its endpoint infrastructure. In addition, the Client Platform Engineering Team wanted to adopt Infrastructure as Code with GitOps to align with Fastly’s standards. A key mandate was to ensure smooth migration to minimize impact to end-users.

## Choosing Fleet

While Fastly evaluated several options for their corporate endpoints, the choice quickly narrowed to Fleet. The platform was already a proven entity within the company, managed by the infrastructure team to provide visibility across 100+ global CDN Points of Presence (POPs). 

By expanding their existing self-hosted instance to employee devices, Fastly gained a unified security posture. This transition was further eased by Fleet’s high-touch support model, which favored direct Slack communication and active partnership over the transactional service typical of other vendors.

## The results

Fastly worked closely with the Fleet team to plan for the migration of MacOS devices. After about three months of planning, the migration went very smoothly. With over 99.9% of Macs migrated within 45 days, Fastly saw very low ticket counts, and experienced a smooth transition.

One key benefit was aligning employee device visibility with that of the infrastructure team running their POPs. With a single endpoint and server visibility service, the Fastly team unified visibility across approximately 1,200 employee devices and more than 100 global Points-of-Presence, consolidating visibility and management into a single vendor and reducing the overhead of managing multiple tools.

The enhanced visibility allowed the endpoint team to run more powerful queries and reports into the state of their endpoints. With Fleet’s support for Automated Device Enrollment and Identity Provider integrations, Fastly could now introduce user authentication during device enrollment, allowing the employee attributes to be tied to the endpoints. 

The move to Fleet also enabled Fastly to manage endpoints using GitOps and Infrastructure as Code. This aligned endpoint management with Fastly’s existing DevOps standards, improved change control, and helped treat endpoint management as an engineering practice rather than a set of manual tasks.

*Fleet enabled us to consolidate our patchwork of endpoint tools with a single platform, eliminating complexity and cutting licensing costs. The shift to GitOps has modernized our operations giving us the agility and change control we needed giving leadership real-time confidence in device health and compliance. The result is a more efficient, secure environment where IT can move faster on strategic projects instead of firefighting or maintaining multiple legacy systems.*
