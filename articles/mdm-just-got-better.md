# MDM just got better: Apple’s biggest IT updates at WWDC25

macOS 26 Tahoe, iOS 26, iPadOS 26, watchOS 26, and visionOS 26 bring powerful changes for Apple admins and IT teams. Hidden in the WWDC25 documentation are updates that quietly transform how organisations onboard, migrate, and manage Apple devices at scale.

## Setup Assistant & Platform SSO just leveled Up

Platform Single Sign-On (SSO) is now fully integrated into Setup Assistant on macOS, bringing major enhancements to enterprise provisioning:

- Authenticate with your Identity Provider (IdP) during Automated Device Enrollment  
- Automatically create local accounts with synced IdP details (photos, display names)  
- Enable silent enrollment using Managed Device Attestation  
- Skip setup screens for a faster, more consistent experience  
- Support for Guest Mode with authentication on shared Macs  
- Tap-to-login using iPhone or Apple Watch Access Key  
- Improved Managed Apple ID sign-in  

This delivers the most frictionless macOS authentication experience to date — secure, seamless, and optimised for large-scale deployment. New devices now onboard faster, with fewer steps and stronger identity controls.

## Managed device migration

Apple just made switching MDMs a lot easier. You can now move macOS devices between MDM servers in Apple Business Manager or School Manager—no need to wipe, rely on scripts, or use a vendor migration app. For iOS and iPadOS devices, migration is now possible without starting from scratch.

Whether you’re switching providers, consolidating tools after an acquisition, or moving from cloud to on-prem (or vice versa), device migration is now native, scalable, and user-driven.

Apple Business Manager and Apple School Manager introduce:

- Enforced migration deadlines with persistent user prompts  
- Full-screen modals or reboot requirements if migration is delayed  
- Preservation of Activation Lock and FileVault keys  
- App and settings restoration if the new MDM provides them promptly  
- Prompt to reconnect if the device is offline during migration  

Whether you’re moving thousands of Macs or iPads, the barrier to change your MDM solution has never been lower.

## Declarative management expands

Apple is continuing its shift to declarative device management, with big gains for automation and compliance:

- Declarative App Management now on macOS  
- `DelayOSUpdates` supports business-hour deferral windows  
- Apple TV and Vision Pro gain declarative software update support  
- Status reporting now includes app update states and more  

DDM is faster, more reliable, and requires fewer round trips to your MDM server.

## Small features, big wins

These updates may be under the radar but they make a real difference:

- Remotely clear Mac passcodes without wiping  
- Return to Service now preserves apps as well as the OS  
- Battery health reporting arrives on iPad  
- Configurator and Shortcuts now work together for automated staging  
- Privacy-first content filtering using PIR and OHTTP  
- Safari settings management: bookmarks, homepages, private browsing  
- Restrict messaging and calling apps to approved services  
- Temporary AirPods pairing that automatically clears  
- Export lists of unmanaged Apple IDs for review  

## Why this matters for IT teams and how Fleet helps

Apple’s WWDC25 updates point to a future of frictionless onboarding, declarative management, and user transparency.

**Fleet delivers that today**, supporting declarative MDM on macOS, iOS, and iPadOS, with zero-touch provisioning via Apple Business Manager and Windows Autopilot.
