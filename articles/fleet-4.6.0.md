Fleet 4.6.0 introduces instructions in the Fleet UI for generating an osquery installer package for macOS, Linux, or Windows. The Fleet osquery installer is an osquery runtime and auto-updater, that extends osquery; makes it easy to deploy, manage configurations, and stay up to date.

The Fleet osquery installer is our recommended agent for Fleet, but it can be used with or without Fleet as a (near) drop-in replacement for osquery, and vice-versa.

### Manage enroll secrets in the Fleet UI

**Available in Fleet Free & Fleet Premium**

The ability to manage enroll secrets is a helpful addition for team maintainers who need to manage enrollment keys across their teams, or for users who may need to rotate enroll secrets according to their company‚Äôs security policy.

Users can now create a new enroll secret in the Fleet UI, generate a new osquery installer with the new secret, distribute it to their hosts, and remove the old enrollment key.

### View scheduled queries on specific hosts via the host details page

**Available in Fleet Free & Fleet Premium**

![View scheduled queries on specific hosts via the host details page](../website/assets/images/articles/fleet-4.6.0-3-700x393@2x.png)

Users can now see all of their queries scheduled to run on a specific host from the host details page, so they can be confident that the correct data will be sent to their log destination.

### System users‚Äô login shell information is now available from the Fleet UI‚Äôs host details page.

**Available in Fleet Free & Fleet Premium**

![System users' login shell information is now available from the Fleet UI's host details page](../website/assets/images/articles/fleet-4.6.0-4-700x393@2x.png)

Login shell information is now visible from the system users section of the host details page. The user section can now be filtered to see only those who have logged into the host.

- Team Admins can now remove themselves from a team and be redirected to the Dashboard as expected.

- There was a bug that is now no more, where the team policy filter was redirecting to the wrong page when canceled.
- Fleet Free is free, but there were a handful of erroneous 402 payment-required errors cropping up where they shouldn‚Äôt have been. This has now been resolved.
- Multiselect checkboxes were doing some funky renderings when managing queries, but they‚Äôre back in check now (a little Dad joke, there.)
- We fixed an issue where `POST api/v1/fleet/targets` was returning a 422 error for Team Admins.
- We also fixed a bunch of misbehaving UI elements that are now rendering correctly/doing what they are supposed to be doing.
- And lastly, we resolved some styling issues where certain layouts weren‚Äôt behaving at 1024px breakpoints.
