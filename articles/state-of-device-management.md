The devices their employees use power businesses: laptops, tablets, smartphones, and other mobile technology. Sometimes the organization issues these devices, but many are employees’ personal devices — and in today’s remote environment, their work could happen anywhere.

But how does an organization manage those devices? Do they know if their devices are compliant and secure? Do they have ways to query them to learn more about their status in real-time? Or are organizations unprepared and overwhelmed with managing thousands or hundreds of thousands of endpoints?

At Fleet, we help security teams and IT professionals track and secure their organization’s laptops and servers. But outside of the organizations, we work with, we wanted to know more about the current state of device management, in general, to better understand how security teams manage their endpoints. What we found indicates that organizations may not be managing devices as successfully and thoroughly as they should be in order to keep themselves safe.

We hope you consider these insights and findings as you build your device management strategy in 2022.
