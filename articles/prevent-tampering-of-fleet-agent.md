# Prevent tampering of Fleet agent and installer settings on Windows

## Introduction
On Windows, users with administrative rights can remove or modify management agents like **Fleet Orbit**.  
Unlike many EDR and DLP tools with built-in tamper protection, Fleet doesn’t attempt to hide or lock itself down. This is intentional—Fleet is built on **openness and transparency**, with enforcement driven by policies you can see and manage.

But that doesn't mean you're left unprotected. To keep the agent in place, IT teams can add their own guardrails using a combination of:

- A PowerShell script that sets hardened registry values  
- A Fleet policy that checks those values and reapplies them if missing  
- A Windows configuration profile that blocks MDM unenrollment  

Together, these components create a **self-healing enforcement loop** that ensures protections remain in place, without relying on hidden or opaque mechanisms.

## Hardening the installer
One way to harden the installer is to apply registry values through a PowerShell script to help prevent uninstallation or tampering of protected applications.

## Policies in Fleet
A Fleet policy confirms that the hardened registry key exists. If the key is missing, the policy fails, triggering automation to rerun the script. Once applied, the policy becomes compliant. If tampering occurs later, the cycle repeats.

**Note:** On first run, this policy intentionally fails to ensure automation executes the hardening script.

## Blocking unenrollment
A configuration profile can prevent devices from unenrolling from MDM.

**Microsoft CSP reference**  
The `AllowManualMDMUnenrollment` CSP is only supported on certain versions of Windows—verify compatibility before deployment.

## More advanced approaches
More mature organisations may already be using additional controls to protect against tampering. For example:

- **ADMX-backed CSPs** such as `ADMX_AddRemovePrograms`, which can restrict software removal across the board.  
  - Protects all applications, not just Fleet. 

- **AppLocker** or similar application control solutions, which can explicitly block execution of unapproved installers or uninstallers.  
  - Powerful, but requires careful design and typically broader adoption.  

The **Fleet script + policy + profile** approach offers a lightweight, targeted way to enforce persistence without restricting unrelated applications.

## Conclusion
Combining a PowerShell hardening script, a Fleet policy with automation, and a configuration profile gives you dependable protection against tampering with the Fleet agent and other critical installer settings.

Fleet’s open model makes enforcement visible and verifiable—without relying on concealed or fragile mechanisms.
