# Redefining endpoint management at scale: Fleet’s momentum in the 2026 Gartner reports

The world’s most valuable companies share a common trait: they don’t settle for "good enough" infrastructure. They demand precision, programmability, and scale. Yet, for too long, the endpoint management market has been defined by legacy suites; black boxes that are difficult to automate, hard to query, and opaque to the end user.

At Fleet, we are building the open standard for device management. We are now supporting over 1,300 customers and managing more than 2,000,000 endpoints. Today, we are seeing our modern approach validated by one of the world’s leading research firms.

Gartner recently released its 2026 reports for the endpoint management market. Fleet has been recognized across multiple strategic documents, validating that our open, GitOps-driven architecture is not just an alternative, but the future for complex, high-scale environments.

## Validation of a modern, engineering-first architecture

In the Midmarket Context: 'Magic Quadrant for Endpoint Management Tools' (2026), Gartner provided a deep-dive profile of Fleet. While the report title references the midmarket, the specific capabilities Gartner analyzed identify exactly why Fleet is winning in sophisticated enterprise environments.

Gartner didn't focus on basic features. The analysis highlighted the architectural differentiators that matter most to platform engineers and IT leaders:

### The "GitOps" standard

Modern enterprises manage infrastructure as code. Why should employee devices be any different? Gartner explicitly highlighted Fleet’s **"API and GitOps-driven approaches"**. This is a massive recognition of our design philosophy. We believe you shouldn’t have to click through web wizards to manage 50,000 laptops. Gartner recognizes that our platform allows teams to manage device state the same way they manage cloud infrastructure - via code, version control, and CI/CD pipelines.

### "Heavily customizable" for complex environments

Enterprises rarely fit into a "one-size-fits-all" box. Gartner describes the Fleet solution as **"heavily customizable"**. For large organizations with unique compliance needs and complex workflows, Fleet provides the flexibility to adapt to the environment, not the other way around.

### Real-time data access

At scale, stale data is useless data. Gartner’s profile highlights Fleet’s ability to deliver **"real-time reporting, visibility, and data retrieval via osquery"**. This acknowledges that our underlying architecture—built on the open-source osquery standard - gives IT teams direct, raw access to system data instantly, or on a scheduled interval.

### Transparency as culture

Large organizations are increasingly focused on employee trust. Gartner noted that Fleet **"provides transparency to end users by clarifying how their devices are managed, including what actions and automations IT can execute... and what data is collected"**. We believe that at enterprise scale visibility shouldn't come at the cost of breaking organizational culture or end user trust.

## Scalability recognized in the Magic Quadrant

Our momentum is further confirmed in the 2026 Magic Quadrant for Endpoint Management Tools. Fleet appears as an "Honorable Mention" in this prestigious report.

The Magic Quadrant inclusion criteria required vendors to have **"at least 5 million active endpoints under management"** to be visualized in the chart. While we are currently at 2 million endpoints and growing rapidly, our inclusion is a significant milestone.

Gartner describes Fleet as a **"scalable, open-source platform"**. Being recognized as a scalable challenger in the same breath as massive incumbents validates that our model is ready for the heavy lifting required by the largest companies in the world. We are rapidly closing the gap with large competitors on endpoint count because organizations have come to realize open-source extensibility results in business value.

## Defining the future of device management

Additionally, the Market Guide for Endpoint Management Tools (2025) lists Fleet as a "Representative Vendor". This report discusses the market's shift toward automation and the reduction of manual labor.

This aligns perfectly with the Fleet promise. Fleet is not just another tool for small IT shops; it is the extensive device management layer the enterprise needs today.

## Why the "Largest and most valuable" organizations choose Fleet

We are seeing a shift in how enterprises approach IT operations: moving away from bloated suites toward composable, transparent tools.

- **Visibility:** Fleet gives you the ability to query your device deployment like a database. Get answers in seconds.
- **Automation:** Fleet enables admins to automate IT device management workflows via APIs and GitOps. Manual console clicking is no longer the only way to work.
- **Control:** Fleet allows engineering teams to manage the Fleet console declaratively as code. Ensure consistency across Windows, macOS, iOS, iPadOS, Linux, Android and ChromeOS.

Gartner’s latest research confirms that the market is hungry for a "scalable, open-source platform" with "community-driven extensibility". That is exactly what Fleet has built.

We are proud to serve some of the most advanced engineering teams in the world, and we are just getting started.
