# Deploy Fleet on GCP

This Terraform project automates the deployment of Fleet on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP). It provisions a new GCP project (or uses an existing one if configured) and deploys all necessary infrastructure components, including:

- A new Google Cloud Project (via terraform-google-modules/project-factory)
- VPC Network and Subnets
- Cloud NAT for outbound internet access
- Cloud SQL for MySQL (database for Fleet)
- Memorystore for Redis (caching for Fleet)
- Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket (for Fleet software installers, S3-compatible access configured)
- Google Secret Manager (for storing sensitive data like database passwords and Fleet server private key)
- Cloud Run v2 Service (for the main Fleet application)
- Cloud Run v2 Job (for database migrations)
- External HTTP(S) Load Balancer with managed SSL certificate
- Cloud DNS for managing the Fleet endpoint
- Appropriate IAM service accounts and permissions

## Prerequisites

1. [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform) version ~> 1.11.
2. [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk) installed and configured.
3. GCP account & permissions:
    - A Google Cloud organization ID.
    - A billing account ID.
    - Credentials configured for Terraform to interact with GCP. This typically means running   gcloud auth application-default login with a user account that has:
    - Organization administrator or folder creator & project creator roles at the organization/  folder level (for the project-factory module).
    - Billing account user role on the billing account.
    - Once the project is created, subsequent applies for resources within the project will   generally require owner or editor on the provisioned project.
    - Alternatively, use a service account with appropriate permissions.
4. Registered domain name: You will need a domain name that you can manage DNS records for. This project will create a Cloud DNS Managed Zone for this domain (or a subdomain).
5. (Optional) Fleet license key: If you have a Fleet Premium license, you can provide it.

## Configuration

1.  [Clone the repository](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet-terraform/tree/e8d559ecba80ab35cb8014212f5bd0a22b545618/gcp) or consume the entire project as a Terraform module. Below is a minimal example of how to declare the module in your Terraform configuration:

```hcl
module "fleet" {
  source             = "github.com/fleetdm/fleet-terraform/gcp"
  billing_account_id = "123"
  org_id             = "456"
  dns_record_name    = "myfleetdeployment.com."
  dns_zone_name      = "myfleetdeployment.com."
  project_name       = "fleetgcp"

  fleet_config = {
    installers_bucket_name = "fleet-installers-bucket"
  }
}
```

2.  Create a `terraform.tfvars` file and paste in the folowing, populated with your specific values:

```hcl
# Required: GCP Organization and Billing
org_id               = "YOUR_ORGANIZATION_ID" # e.g., "123456789012"
billing_account_id   = "YOUR_BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID" # e.g., "012345-6789AB-CDEF
# Required: DNS Configuration
# The public DNS zone name (e.g., "example.com." - note the trailing dot)
# This project will create/manage this zone in Cloud DNS.
dns_zone_name        = "your-domain.com."
# The fully qualified domain name for your Fleet instance (e.g., "fleet.your-domain.com.")
dns_record_name      = "fleet.your-domain.co
# Optional: Project Configuration
project_name         = "my-fleet-project" # Name for the new GCP project
random_project_id    = true               # Set to false if you want to use project_nameproject_id (must be globally uniq
# Optional: Labels
labels = {
  application = "fleetdm"
  environment = "production"
  owner       = "devops-team"

# --- byo-project module specific variables (passed through from root) ---
# You can override defaults from byo-project/variables.tf here if needed,
# or set values for variables that don't have defaul
# Example: Fleet Configuration including migration execution
fleet_config = {
  # image_tag                = "fleetdm/fleet:v4.x.y" # Specify your desired Fleet version
  # license_key              = "YOUR_FLEET_LICENSE_KEY"
  # installers_bucket_name   = "my-unique-fleet-installers" # Must be globally unique
  # fleet_cpu                = "1000m"
  # fleet_memory             = "4096Mi"
  # debug_logging            = false
  # min_instance_count       = 1
  # max_instance_count       = 3
  # exec_migration           = true # Set to true to run migrations on `terraform apply`
                                   # (e.g., when changing image_tag)

```

### Key variables to set:

| Variable | Notes |
| :--- | :--- |
| `org_id` | Your GCP organization ID. |
| `billing_account_id` | Your GCP billing account ID. |
| `dns_zone_name` | The DNS zone that will be created/managed in Cloud DNS (e.g., `mydomain.com.`). **Must end with a dot.** |
| `dns_record_name` | The specific DNS record for Fleet (e.g., `fleet.mydomain.com.`). **Must end with a dot.** |
| `project_name` | A descriptive name for the project to be created. |
| `fleet_config.image_tag` | The Docker image tag for the Fleet version you want to deploy (e.g., `fleetdm/fleet:v4.67.3`). |
| `fleet_config.exec_migration` |  Set to `true` when you are upgrading the `fleet_config.image_tag` to automatically run database migrations. Set to `false` if you want to manage migrations manually or if it's not an image upgrade. |
| `fleet_config.license_key` (Optional, inside the `fleet_config` object) | Your Fleet license key if you have one. |

> Note: Review [`variables.tf`](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet-terraform/blob/e8d559ecba80ab35cb8014212f5bd0a22b545618/gcp/variables.tf) and [`byo-project/variables.tf`](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet-terraform/blob/e8d559ecba80ab35cb8014212f5bd0a22b545618/gcp/byo-project/variables.tf) for all available options and their defaults.

## Deployment Steps

1.  Authenticate with GCP
> Ensure your `gcloud` CLI is authenticated with the account having the necessary permissions.

```bash
gcloud auth application-default login
```

2.  Initialize Terraform. Navigate to the root directory of the project (where `main.tf` is located) and run:

```bash
terraform init
```

3.  Review the changes Terraform will make:

```bash
terraform plan -out=tfplan
```

4.  Apply the Configuration to provision the resources:

```bash
terraform apply tfplan
```

    > This process can take a significant amount of time (10â€“20 minutes or more), especially for the initial project creation, API enablement, and Cloud SQL instance provisioning.

5.  Update DNS (if not using Cloud DNS for the parent zone). If `dns_zone_name` (e.g., `fleet.your-domain.com.`) is a new zone created by this Terraform, and your parent domain (e.g., `your-domain.com.`) is managed elsewhere (e.g., Cloudflare), you need to delegate this new zone.
    - Get the Name Servers (NS) records for the newly created `google_dns_managed_zone${var.prefix}-zone`):
    
```bash
# First, get the project ID and zone name if you don't know them
PROJECT_ID=$(terraform output -raw project_id 2>/dev/null || gcloud projects  list  filter="name~^my-fleet-project" --format="value(projectId)" | head  -n 1)
DNS_ZONE_INTERNAL_NAME="fleet-zone" # Or as configured by 'prefix' variable

gcloud dns managed-zones describe ${DNS_ZONE_INTERNAL_NAME} \
    --project=${PROJECT_ID} \
    --format="value(nameServers)"
```

- Add these NS records to your parent domain's DNS settings at your domain registrar or DNS provider.
  
> If `dns_zone_name` (e.g., `your-domain.com.`) was an *existing* zone you own and manage via Cloud DNS in this project, Terraform would add records to it directly. The current setup *creates* the zone, so delegation is key if the parent is external.

## Accessing Fleet

Once the deployment is complete, database migrations have run successfully, and DNS has propagated (which can take a few minutes):

- Open your web browser and navigate to the `dns_record_name` you configured (e.g., `https://fleet.your-domain.com`).
- You should be greeted by the Fleet setup page or login screen.

## Key Resources Created (within the byo-project module)

- VPC Network (`fleet-network`): Custom network for Fleet resources.
- Subnet (`fleet-subnet`): Subnetwork within the VPC.
- Cloud Router & NAT (`fleet-cloud-router`, `fleet-vpc-nat`):** For outbound internet access from Cloud Run and other private resources.
- Cloud SQL for MySQL (`fleet-mysql-xxxx`): Managed MySQL database.
- Memorystore for Redis (`fleet-cache`): Managed Redis instance.
- GCS Bucket (`fleet-installers-xxxx`): For S3-compatible storage.
- Secret Manager Secrets:**
    - `fleet-db-password-xxxx`: Stores the generated MySQL user password.
    - `fleet-private-key-xxxx`: Stores a generated private key for Fleet server.
- Service Account (`fleet-run-sa`): Used by Cloud Run services/jobs with necessary permissions.
- Cloud Run Service (`fleet-service`): Hosts the main Fleet application.
- Cloud Run Job (`fleet-migration-job`): For database migrations.
- Network Endpoint Group (`fleet-neg`): Connects the Load Balancer to the Cloud Run service.
- Cloud DNS Managed Zone (`fleet-zone`): Manages DNS records for `dns_zone_name`.
- External HTTP(S) Load Balancer (`fleet-lb`): Provides public access to Fleet via HTTPS.
- DNS A Record: Points `dns_record_name` to the Load Balancer's IP.

> Note: `xxxx` indicates a random suffix added by some modules/resources for uniqueness.

## Cleaning Up

To destroy all resources created by this Terraform project:
1.  Navigate to the root directory of the project.
2.  Run the destroy command:

```
terraform destroy
```

3.  Confirm by typing `yes` when prompted.

## Important Considerations

- Permissions: The user or service account running Terraform needs extensive permissions, especially for project creation. For ongoing management within the project, a role like `Project Editor` or more granular roles might suffice.
- Fleet Configuration: This Terraform setup provisions the infrastructure. Further Fleet application configuration (e.g., SSO, SMTP, agent options) will need to be done through the Fleet UI or API after deployment.
- Security:
    - Review IAM permissions granted.
    - The Load Balancer is configured for HTTPS and redirects HTTP.
    - Cloud SQL and Memorystore are not publicly accessible and are connected via Private Service Access.
- Scalability: Cloud Run scaling parameters (`min_instance_count`, `max_instance_count`) and database/cache tier can be adjusted in `variables.tf` (via `fleet_config`, `database_config`, `cache_config`) to suit your load.
