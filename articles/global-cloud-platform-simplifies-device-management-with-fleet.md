# Global edge cloud platform simplifies device management with Fleet

<div purpose="attribution-quote">

We had a different MDM for Mac, a different MDM for Windows, and a different MDM for Linux... it’s just too much.

## Challenge

The cloud platform was managing thousands of devices with multiple tools across multiple operating systems and global locations, resulting in fragmented processes and unreliable asset data. This complexity compromised security, compliance, and operational efficiency, making it difficult to maintain consistent device check-ins and accurate inventory.

## Solution

They implemented Fleet, a unified device management platform that centralizes operations for macOS, Windows, and Linux into a single system. It delivers real-time data insights alongside universal MDM capabilities and provides self-service tools for employees. Fleet also seamlessly integrates with existing tools and supports GitOps workflows to facilitate their rapid global growth.

## Results

<div purpose="checklist">

Reduced tool overlap by eliminating the need to manage multiple MDM platforms for each operating system. Furthermore, Fleet’s in-depth data insights allowed them to replace other tools that were deployed alongside their previous MDM solution to maintain full control over their infrastructure. 

Use Fleet to gather and share definitive data across their other teams and systems, simplifying compliance processes and making audits less of a burden.

Automated updates with Fleet’s policy automations to reduce manual intervention for software updates and patching, keeping their devices more secure and freeing IT resources.

Improved support efficiency with accurate, real-time data, allowing support teams to resolve issues faster and assist employees more effectively.

Use Fleet’s zero-touch onboarding and self-service capabilities to provide a great out-of-the-box user experience for onboarding, while also empowering employees to stay productive without needing to reach out to IT.

Fleet consolidated the previous device management strategy by eliminating multiple MDM tools, enhancing operational efficiency, and ensuring robust security and compliance. Automation and next-gen change management freed IT resources for strategic tasks, and self-service capabilities improved support efficiency and employee productivity.


## Their story

This company is a global edge cloud platform that empowers developers to create fast, secure, and scalable digital experiences. By providing a programmable edge cloud, they enable businesses to deliver content quickly and securely to users around the world.

While continuing to expand, managing a diverse range of devices across multiple teams and locations became increasingly complex. Existing legacy tools resulted in fragmented processes, inconsistent device check-ins, and unreliable asset inventory data. This posed challenges to security, compliance, and operational efficiency. Specifically, they aimed to:

- Manage a Fleet of thousands of devices across a distributed workforce.
- Ensure endpoint compliance and security to meet stringent audit requirements.
- Simplify processes across multiple platforms to reduce operational complexity.
- Integrate existing tools for accurate, up-to-date inventory data.

A unified solution was needed to replace multiple device management suppliers with a single platform. Fleet provided the tools and flexibility required to address these challenges through:

### Eliminating tool overlap

Fleet’s centralized platform enabled the combination of device operations across macOS, Windows, and Linux with a unified reporting language. This included:

- Deploying custom settings and executing MDM commands (such as lock, sleep, wipe).
- Notifying end-users of OS update deadlines to ensure compliance.
- Generating detailed reports on disk encryption, software vulnerabilities, and USB usage.
- Comprehensive reports on installed apps and versions.

### Reliable inventory management and definitive data for instant audits

Fleet pulls all of the inventory and device health quickly, simplifying and expediting the preparation of audit reports with accurate and verifiable data.  Along with the ability to contextualize the data, Fleet’s robust API endpoints allowed them to automate processes and institute more clear guidelines. This is critical not only for preparing for audits but also during security reviews.

### Comprehensive automation

Being API-first, programmable, and built for automation, Fleet features policy automation  to help reduce traditional manual workloads. Engineers can focus on strategic initiatives instead of app updates, installs, and the need to manually trigger scripts and reports.

### Open-source flexibility and GitOps capabilities
Fleet’s open-source nature provided the transparency and customization needed to tailor the platform to their requirements and integrate with existing tools. Integrations with GitOps workflows generated the ability to:

- Update and deploy custom settings across macOS and Windows devices.
- Manage OS updates with custom deadlines.
- Implement change control and reduce mistakes through peer reviews.
- maintain consistent zero-touch onboarding and self-service.

In addition to automated patching, Fleet empowers employees with self-service tools for additional app installation and policy remediation with Fleet Desktop. Employees can see what IT sees on their devices, including which policies they’re failing, and empower them to resolve issues without escalation. All from the first time they open their device with zero-touch onboarding.


## Conclusion

Fleet has become an essential part of this cloud platform's infrastructure, allowing the company to manage its devices more effectively. By consolidating tools across platforms, Fleet simplified device operations and ensured compliance with stringent requirements. The platform’s automation and real-time data capabilities reduced manual efforts and provided accurate insights, while its self-service tools helped employees resolve unique issues independently. These improvements have supported the goals of maintaining security, reliability, and efficient operations as the company continues to grow.

By adopting Fleet, they've transformed its device management processes, achieving greater security, reliability, and scalability to support its global operations.
