# Using maintenance windows (Fleet in your calendar)

![Configuring maintenance windows in Fleet](../website/assets/images/articles/configuring-maintenance-windows-in-fleet-1600x900@2x.jpg)

Fleet helps end users fix issues on their own by scheduling a maintenance window directly on their calendarâ€”no IT ticket required.

When a host fails a policy (e.g. MDM enrollment profile expired, disk encryption disabled, outdated software), Fleet can notify the user via a Google Calendar event. The event includes:

* Whatâ€™s wrong (based on policy description)
* What to do (from the policy resolution field)
* A scheduled time (next available slot on Tuesday, 9â€“5 local time)

The user can reschedule if neededâ€”Fleet will respect the new time and run the remediation then.

You can customize these flows with a webhook (e.g. Tines) to run scripts, use the Fleet API, or call MDM commands.

> ðŸ”œ Auto-remediation for patching (OS updates, software) is coming soon.

### Setup

1. Connect a Google Workspace service account to Fleet under **Settings > Integrations > Calendars**.
2. Create a webhook to handle the remediation (see [Fleet + Tines guide](https://fleetdm.com/guides/building-webhook-flows-with-fleet-and-tines)).
3. In the **Policies** tab, click **Manage automations > Calendar events**, enable the feature, and paste your webhook URL.

### End user experience

* If a user owns multiple failing hosts, only one host is scheduled at a time. Once it's fixed, Fleet schedules the next.
* If a host has multiple users, Fleet chooses one user to receive the event.
* Users can reschedule the event on their calendarâ€”Fleet will run remediation at the new time.
* If a user moves the event to before the current time, Fleet shifts it to the next day.
* If a user deletes the event, Fleet automatically reschedules it for the next day.
* Fleet monitors calendar changes in real time (reschedules within ~30 seconds), but only for events in the upcoming week. Events further out are updated within 30 minutes.

### What happens when a policy fails?

1. A calendar event is scheduled for the user who owns the host.
2. Fleet waits for the scheduled time, then calls the webhook with host + failure details.
