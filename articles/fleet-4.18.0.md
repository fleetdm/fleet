Fleet 4.18.0 is up and running. Check out the full [changelog](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/releases/tag/fleet-v4.18.0) or continue reading to get the highlights.

## Highlights
- Enjoy improved security for Fleet Desktop.
- Show your end users a call to action in Fleet desktop for failing policies.

## Improved security for Fleet Desktop
**Available in Fleet Free and Fleet Premium**

Fleet Desktop uses a random UUID to authenticate to the Fleet server. While it's extremely unlikely to fall victim to a brute-force attack, it's always better to be safe than sorry. In order to combat that possibility, we've added rate limiting for all device authorized endpoints. 

## Show your end users a call to action in Fleet Desktop for failing policies
**Available in Fleet Free & Fleet Premium**

The main goal of Fleet Desktop is to empower end users to take charge of managing the security of their enrolled device. If a device is failing a policy check, Fleet Desktop will now show end users useful information for resolving the issue and make it easy to check if they've fixed it.
