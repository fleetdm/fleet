## Highlights

- Automatically install software
- Fleetctl on Linux ARM
- faster employee onboarding

### Automatically install software

Fleet can now automatically install App Store (VPP) apps when a macOS host fails a policy. This removes the need for third-party automation tools, making large-scale app deployment easier and more reliable.

### Fleetctl on Linux ARM

IT admins using Linux ARM workstations can now use the fleetctl command-line interface (CLI) to manage hosts, execute queries, and run scripts. This expands Fleetâ€™s CLI capabilities, allowing more teams to integrate Fleet into their workflows.

### Faster employee onboarding

During new employee onboarding, Macs now download bootstrap packages and software from the nearest CloudFront region. This speeds up onboarding for new employees, ensuring they get the tools they need without unnecessary delays.
