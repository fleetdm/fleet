## Highlights

- Automatically install software
- Fleetctl on Linux ARM
- Faster employee onboarding

### Automatically install software

Fleet can now automatically install App Store (VPP) apps when a macOS host fails a policy. This removes the need for third-party automation tools, making large-scale app deployment easier and more reliable. Learn more about installing software [here](https://fleetdm.com/guides/automatic-software-install-in-fleet).

### Fleetctl for Linux ARM

Fleet users with Linux ARM workstations can now use the fleetctl command-line interface (CLI) to run scripts, queries, and more. This expands Fleet’s CLI capabilities, allowing users to manage hosts on their preferred operating system (OS). Learn more about fleetctl [here](https://fleetdm.com/guides/fleetctl).

### Faster employee onboarding

During new employee onboarding, Macs now download bootstrap packages and software from the nearest CloudFront region. This speeds up onboarding for new employees, ensuring they get the tools they need without unnecessary delays.
