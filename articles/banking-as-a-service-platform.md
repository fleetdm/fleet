# Banking-as-a-service platform

## Reliable automation for regulated financial services

A banking-as-a-service platform facilitating digital transactions in emerging markets. They needed to move away from failed legacy tools to a platform with guaranteed script execution.

## At a glance

- **Endpoints:** ~287 (evenly split Mac and Windows).  
- **Primary Requirement:** Guaranteed remote script execution and patching automation.  
- **Key Integrations:** Datadog and Amazon Workspaces.  
- **Previous Solution:** Workspace ONE.  

## The Challenge: Critical Failures

They experienced "critical failures" with Workspace ONE, including unreliable macOS updates, very limited visibility across standard endpoints and servers,  and inability to monitor remote script output. They also could not manage Amazon Workspaces (VMs), which was a major blind spot.

## The Solution: Regulated Transparency

They switched to Fleet for its modern, API-driven workflows. The transparency of the open-source model was essential for compliance tracking in the highly regulated financial sector.

## The Results: Audit Readiness

- **Proving Compliance:** Transparency improved their ability to prove the state of their fleet with certainty during financial audits.  
- **Customized Remediation:** They now use SQL-based osquery queries to automate the "fix" when a device falls out of compliance.  
- **Unified Vitals:** Direct streaming to Datadog centralizes device vitals within the same dashboards used for their banking infrastructure.
