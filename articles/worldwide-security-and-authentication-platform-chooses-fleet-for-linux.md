# Worldwide security and authentication platform chooses Fleet for Linux management

“My biggest issue with Linux is that no one considers Linux. It's never the first thing. It's always the last thing. And as the advocate and evangelist for Linux in the IT org broadly, I have to make the security guys stop and go, hey, hang on a second. We're also here. You know, we matter…” — Technical Systems Engineer


## Challenge

The security and authentication platform faced challenges in configuring its management of Linux desktop users and ensuring compliance parity, such as enforcing disk encryption and maintaining up-to-date OS versions. Traditional MDM platforms and tools fell short of effectively addressing these needs. Existing tools were built only to solve parts of the puzzle, leading to fragmented processes. They lacked comprehensive automation and integration capabilities that failed to address the unique needs of their growing Linux user base.


## Solution

By adopting Fleet, they were able to unify their [device management](https://fleetdm.com/device-management) across the organization. Fleet’s robust API and webhook support enabled seamless automation and integration with existing systems. Features such as remote lock and wipe, failed policy remediation, and support for multiple Linux distributions introduced the security controls and flexibility they require. Additionally, Fleet facilitated the migration from legacy tools, allowing them to enforce security settings without overly restricting endpoints or their users.


## Results

- Fleet enabled Linux device management and replaced legacy tools for telemetry and system configuration. This reduced their previously typical compliance woes and lack of standard MDM features. 

- Employees are free to work with their preferred operating systems of choice.

- [Fleet’s API](https://fleetdm.com/docs/rest-api/rest-api) and live query capabilities ensured up-to-date inventory data to meet stringent security and access control requirements while integrating with existing systems.

- Fleet’s policy automation ensures that software and configurations can remain secure without requiring manual intervention, thereby freeing up IT resources.

Implementing Fleet significantly enhanced their device management strategy by centralizing Linux operations, improving security compliance, and increasing the operational efficiency of these previously overlooked devices. Fleet’s automation and integration capabilities ensured accurate and reliable asset inventory across teams, and empowered technical users with self-service tools, maintaining high security standards across all of their devices.


## Their story

A global leader in security and authentication needed a flexible Mobile Device Management (MDM) solution to manage their Linux desktop users effectively. Managing a diverse fleet of Linux devices across multiple teams and locations was becoming increasingly complex with existing tools. Linux has historically been associated with inconsistent device compliance, unreliable asset inventory data, and operational inefficiencies. With this in mind, they aimed to:

- Manage and secure a large fleet of Linux desktops across various Linux distributions, ensuring compliance with policies such as [disk encryption](https://fleetdm.com/guides/enforce-disk-encryption) and up-to-date operating systems.

- Simplify device management processes without compromising on security and access control.

- Integrate device management with existing systems and automate workflows to enhance operational efficiency.

- Support a technically proficient and privacy-conscious Linux user base, ensuring [data privacy](https://fleetdm.com/better) and minimal disruption.

To overcome these challenges, Fleet was introduced to manage their Linux devices. Fleet provided a comprehensive solution that addressed their specific needs through:

### Unified management for Linux desktops 

Fleet centralized device operations for multiple Linux distributions, eliminating the need for separate management tools. This consolidated the management process and consistent policy enforcement across their devices.

### Robust API and webhook support 

Fleet’s extensive API and webhook capabilities enabled seamless automation and integration with existing systems. This allowed the security and authentication platform to automate routine tasks, run live [queries](https://fleetdm.com/guides/queries), and integrate Fleet with their development workflows without relying on additional middleware.

### Advanced security and compliance features

Fleet enforces trusted device policies, including disk encryption and the latest [OS updates](https://fleetdm.com/guides/enforce-os-updates). Additional capabilities like [remote lock and wipe](https://fleetdm.com/guides/lock-wipe-hosts) ensure that they can maintain security and choose when to completely restrict endpoint access, addressing the need for balanced security measures.

### Role-based access controls (RBAC) 

Fleet’s [role-based access controls](https://fleetdm.com/guides/role-based-access) enabled the company to assign specific permissions to different teams, ensuring that access controls were maintained without disabling features across the entire fleet. 

### Seamless migration and integration

Fleet facilitated the migration and integration with other existing tools through the Fleet API. This ensured continuity in device management and leveraged Fleet’s capabilities for enhanced operational efficiency.

### Scalable and flexible deployment

Fleet’s ability to scale horizontally allowed the company to manage thousands of devices efficiently. With the added bonus of [self-hosting](https://fleetdm.com/docs/deploy/deploy-fleet), Fleet provided the flexibility required to support their global operations and future growth.


## Conclusion

By providing tools typically overlooked for Linux, Fleet's open-source platform completes the circle of high-security standards, compliance, and trust with a technically proficient and privacy-conscious Linux user base. Fleet’s automation and integration capabilities meant that IT could still use the tools they wanted, without leaving Linux behind. This proved vital for the company which continues to scale globally.
