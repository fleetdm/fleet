# Agritech producer replaces manual tracking across 273 devices

The fastest-growing vertically integrated tilapia producer in sub-Saharan Africa, operating a complex, carbon-negative supply chain across Kenya and Rwanda, required a management stack to bridge the gap between centralized corporate offices and remote, rural branches.

## At a glance

- **Endpoints:** 273 (Desktops, laptops, mobile, and specialized logistics hardware).  
- **Primary requirement:** Unified cross-platform support with scalable remote enrollment.  
- **Key integrations:** Inventory systems and predictive analytics platforms.  
- **Previous solution:** Manual tracking (Excel) and fragmented legacy systems.  

## The challenge

Before adopting Fleet, they relied heavily on manual data entry and Excel to track a growing fleet. This created massive "blind spots" in rural Homa Bay and Western Kenya, where remote laptops and mobile devices were difficult to monitor. Without real-time visibility, maintaining the security and health of the technology powering their cold-chain logistics was an uphill battle.

## The solution

They integrated Fleet as a cornerstone of their digital transformation. They required a solution that offered low-code configuration—allowing tech teams to manage the fleet independently—and the transparency to align with international compliance standards. By moving away from "black box" proprietary tools, they gained a single binary to manage everything from hatchery systems to retail branch hardware.

## The results

- **Supply chain integrity:** By streaming telemetry into predictive analytics platforms, the team ensures the technology powering their 36-hour delivery window stays functional, maintaining less than 1% spoilage.  
- **Operational efficiency:** The transition achieved a 100% reduction in manual data entry for key asset management tasks, freeing IT staff to focus on high-impact innovations like drone logistics.  
- **Automated asset tracking:** Using Fleet’s API, the team synced device data directly with warehouse inventory systems, ensuring that critical cold-chain hardware is always accounted for across 89 branches.
