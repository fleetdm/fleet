With Apple's release of macOS 26.0, Fleet helps organizations migrate from Jamf to Fleet — for free*. Our delivery team handles the complex parts: exporting profiles, translating smart groups, replacing extension attributes, mapping policies, and redeploying apps, so your IT team doesn’t have to.

## How It works

Fleet follows Apple’s supported Automated Device Enrollment (ADE) flow. Devices re-enroll automatically, keeping user data and managed apps when possible. Migration deadlines, notifications, and “await configuration” states follow Apple’s best practices. 

>**Note:** Seamless, zero-touch migrations are currently supported for Jamf on-prem instances only.

### Profile & policy replication

Configuration profiles exported from Jamf can be re-applied in Fleet. Smart groups become labels, and extension attributes are replaced with queries, labels, or policies. Jamf policies map directly to Fleet policies using automated remediation scripts or package installs.

### Software deployment, simplified

Apple VPP apps sync directly into Fleet. Custom macOS packages can be uploaded and scoped with labels. License continuity and VPP token migration are maintained automatically within Apple’s 30-day window.

### Security & compliance first

FileVault recovery keys are escrowed to Fleet, and new Activation Lock and security controls are applied during enrollment. Continuous inventory and compliance monitoring keep every device visible and compliant.

## Why customers choose Fleet migration

Fleet’s Jamf migration is free for qualified enterprise customers. The Fleet team handles preparation, mapping, and testing to reduce IT workload.

GitOps by default keeps every configuration version-controlled and repeatable. Canary testing ensures safe rollout windows, and Fleet’s open-source foundation keeps your migration and operations future-proof.
