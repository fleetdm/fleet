Fleet 4.61.0 is live. Check out the full [changelog](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/releases/tag/fleet-v4.61.0) or continue reading to get the highlights.
For upgrade instructions, see our [upgrade guide](https://fleetdm.com/docs/deploying/upgrading-fleet) in the Fleet docs.

## Highlights
- Auto-install software
- Email two-factor authentication (2FA)
- Automatic Windows migration

### Auto-install software

IT admins can now install a Fleet-maintained app on all hosts without writing a custom policy. This simplifies software management and saves time for your end users by ensuring productivity tools like Slack and Zoom are consistently available. Learn more about automatically installing software [here](https://fleetdm.com/guides/automatic-software-install-in-fleet).

### Email two-factor authentication (2FA)

You can now enable email 2FA for Fleet user accounts. This adds an extra layer of security for your "break glass" account that's used to login to Fleet in the rare scenario that your Identify Provider (IdP) goes down. For all other accounts, the best practice is to require users to login with [single-sign on (SSO)](https://fleetdm.com/docs/deploy/single-sign-on-sso).

### Automatic Windows migration

Fleet now supports migrating Windows workstations from your old MDM solution without end user interaction. Once migrated, you can enforce [disk encryption](https://fleetdm.com/guides/enforce-disk-encryption), [OS updates](https://fleetdm.com/guides/enforce-os-updates), and other [custom OS settings](https://fleetdm.com/guides/custom-os-settings) to consolidate device management into a single, cross-platform MDM.

## Changes

## Endpoint operations
- Added support to require email verification (MFA) on each login when setting up a Fleet user outside SSO.
- Extended Linux encryption key escrow support to Ubuntu 20.04.6.
- Added missing APM instrumentation for Fleet API routes.
- Improved label validation when running live queries. Previously, when passing label(s) that do not exist, the labels were ignored. Now, an error is returned indicating which labels were not found. This change affects both the API and `fleetctl query` command.

## Device management (MDM)
- Added functionality for creating an automatic install policy for Fleet-maintained apps.
- Replaced Zoom Fleet-maintained app with Zoom for IT, which does not open any windows during installation.
- Added support for the new `windows_migration_enabled` setting (can be set via `fleetctl`, the `PATCH /api/latest/fleet/config` API endpoint and the UI). Requires a premium license.
- Updated to only show the "follow instructions on My device" banner for Linux hosts whose disks are encrypted but for which Fleet hasn't escrowed a valid key.
- Added App Store app UI: Added different empty state when VPP token is not added at all vs. when it's not assigned to a team to prevent confusion.
- Allowed APNS key to be in unencrypted PKCS8 format, which may happen when migrating from another MDM.
- Allowed calling `/api/v1/fleet/software/fleet_maintained_apps` with no team ID to retrieve the full global list of maintained apps.
- Added UI changes for windows MDM page and allow for automatic migration for windows hosts.
- Bypassed the setup experience UI if there is no setup experience item to process (no software to install, no script to execute), so that releasing the device is done without going through that window.

## Vulnerability management
- Added `without_vulnerability_details` to software versions endpoint (/api/latest/fleet/software/versions) so CVE details can be truncated when on Fleet Premium.
- Fixed an issue where the github cli software name was not matching against the cpe vulnerability name.

## Bug fixes and improvements
- Updated Go version to 1.23.4.
- Update help text for policy automation Install software and run script modals.

- Improved performance of updating the `nano_enrollments.last_seen_at` timestamp of Apple MDM devices by an order of magnitude under load.
- Improved MDM `SELECT FROM nano_enrollment_queue` MySQL query performance, including calling it on DB reader much of the time.
- Updated Inter font to latest version for woff2 files.
- Added better documentation around how the --label flag works in the fleetctl query command.
