With Apple's releases of macOS Tahoe 26, iOS 26, and iPadOS 26, Fleet provides same-day support for IT teams to upgrade immediately so devices will remain secure and fully managed.

## Simplified MDM migration with Apple Business Manager

With MacOS Tahoe 26, iOS 26, and iPadOS 26, Apple introduces Device Management Migration: an improved workflow for migrating devices from one management service (MDM) to another. 

In Apple Business Manager or Apple School Manager, admins can assign devices to a new MDM server and set a migration deadline. Users receive clear notifications that enrollment into a new management service is required. If users do not act before the migration deadline, enrollment into the new MDM is enforced automatically, eliminating the need for device wipes, scripts, or manual workarounds that previously made MDM migrations more difficult, complex and time-consuming.

Fleet is ready to support this migration workflow, making it easier for organizations to migrate devices with minimal disruption.

## Declarative device management (DDM)

Apple continues to expand Declarative Device Management (DDM) across macOS, iOS, and iPadOS. Fleet supports DDM profiles. Fleet admins can take advantage of all the DDM features that Fleet supports today.

## Platform single sign-on

In macOS Tahoe 26, Apple expanded Platform Single Sign-On (PSSO) with a new option for users to enter their credentials as a Setup Assistant step during Automated Device Enrollment. Instead of a local account being created first and enabling PSSO afterward, users can now authenticate with their identity provider as the first setup step. This creates a local account on the Mac linked to the user's identity that's kept in sync with their IdP credentials.

Fleet is working to add support for this new enrollment workflow. Admins will be able to take advantage of it in an upcoming Fleet release.

## Ready from day one

Fleet is ready to help you manage macOS Tahoe 26, iOS 26, and iPadOS 26 from day one so you can upgrade with confidence. Fleet is committed to comprehensive support for all of Apple’s operating system releases.
