With Apple's release of macOS Tahoe 26, iOS 26, and iPadOS 26, Fleet continues to provide same-day support so IT teams can upgrade immediately, knowing their devices will remain secure and fully managed.

## Simplified MDM migration with Apple Business Manager

MacOS Tahoe 26, iOS 26, and iPadOS 26 introduce a first-party workflow for migrating devices between MDMs. In Apple Business Manager, admins can now re-assign a device to a new MDM server and set a migration deadline.

From there, users receive clear notifications that enrollment into a new management service is required. If they don’t act before the deadline, the system guides them through enrollment automatically. This eliminates the need for device wipes, scripts, or manual workarounds that previously made migrations complex and time-consuming.

Fleet is ready to support this migration workflow at release, making it easier for organizations to move devices into Fleet with minimal disruption. You can [learn more](https://support.apple.com/guide/deployment/migrate-managed-devices-dep4acb2aa44/web) about configuring migration in Apple Business Manager.

## Declarative device management (DDM)

Apple continues to expand Declarative Device Management (DDM) across macOS, iOS, and iPadOS. Fleet already supports declarative profiles, so IT teams can take advantage of Apple’s latest management features as soon as they’re released — without waiting for additional updates.

## Platform single sign-on

In macOS Tahoe 26, Apple expanded Platform Single Sign-On (PSSO) with a new option to set it up during Setup Assistant in Automated Device Enrollment. Instead of creating a local account first and enabling PSSO afterward, users can now authenticate with their identity provider as the first step in setup. The Mac then creates a local account linked to that identity, with credentials kept in sync.

Fleet is working to add support for this new enrollment flow, so admins will be able to take advantage of it in an upcoming release.

## Ready from day one

Fleet is ready to manage macOS Tahoe 26, iOS 26, and iPadOS 26 from day one, so you can confidently upgrade. Fleet remains committed to same-day support for Apple’s major operating system releases.
