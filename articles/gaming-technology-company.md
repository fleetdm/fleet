## Powering high-scale gaming with GitOps automation

A global gaming technology company managing over 1,600 endpoints required an automation-first solution to maintain rapid growth and operational resilience.

## At a glance

- **Endpoints:** 1642 (Mac, Windows, Linux, Mobile).  
- **Primary Requirement:** On-premise hosting and GitOps workflows.  
- **Key Integrations:** GitHub Actions.  
- **Previous Solution:** Jamf and JumpCloud.  

## The Challenge: Cumbersome Workflows

Their previous tools had limited GitOps integration and cumbersome workflows that didn't scale. They faced significant "blind spots" with Linux servers and remote laptops before implementing Fleet.

## The Solution: Repeatable Automation

The team chose Fleet for its GitOps-based automation, which enables a level of repeatability and accountability not possible with UI-heavy tools. Self-hosting provided the total infrastructure control they required.

## The Results: Accelerated Security

- **Version Automation:** macOS version string updates are now automated via GitHub Actions.  
- **Lean IT Staff:** By reducing manual configurations, they maintain a lean IT staff focused on high-value security projects.  
- **Dynamic Enforcement:** Real-time telemetry and automated policies have accelerated vulnerability response times dramatically.
