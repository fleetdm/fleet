# Gaming technology company runs GitOps-driven device management on-prem

A global gaming technology company managing over 1,600 endpoints required an automation-first solution to maintain rapid growth and operational resilience.

## At a glance

- **Endpoints:** 1642 (Mac, Windows, Linux, Mobile).  
- **Primary requirement:** On-premise hosting and GitOps workflows.  
- **Key integrations:** GitHub Actions.  
- **Previous solution:** Jamf and JumpCloud.  

## The challenge

Their previous tools had limited GitOps integration and cumbersome workflows that didn't scale. They faced significant "blind spots" with Linux servers and remote laptops before implementing Fleet.

## The solution

The team chose Fleet for its GitOps-based automation, which enables a level of repeatability and accountability not possible with UI-heavy tools. Self-hosting provided the total infrastructure control they required.

## The results

- **Version automation:** macOS version string updates are now automated via GitHub Actions.  
- **Lean IT staff:** by reducing manual configurations, they maintain a lean IT staff focused on high-value security projects.  
- **Dynamic enforcement:** real-time telemetry and automated policies have accelerated vulnerability response times dramatically.
