## Fleet introduces MDM public beta

Fleet has enabled MDM features in the latest release of Fleet as a public beta broadly available to everyone. ðŸŸ£ Openness is at the heart of open-source, and we are excited to bring an open-source MDM. [Read the full announcement.](https://fleetdm.com/releases/fleet-introduces-mdm)

## Granular roles added
_Available in Fleet Premium and Fleet Ultimate_

With this update, you can take ðŸŸ  Ownership of Fleet account roles with greater granularity. Fleet 4.30.0 includes a new user role, `observer+.`

The `observer+` user role extends the observer user role. The observer+ user role can edit and run SQL for a given query without saving the query allowing for greater discovery without overriding the original query. Users with the `observer+` role can also execute [live queries.](https://fleetdm.com/docs/using-fleet/fleet-ui#run-a-query)

## Vulnerability objects include publication date

Knowing how long ago a vulnerability was published, helps gauge the urgency of the vulnerability. Vulnerability objects now include the date a vulnerability was published in the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) to provide you with better ðŸŸ¢ Results. The published date from NVD in the vulnerability object is also available in the Fleet API and when using the vulnerability webhooks.

## Go updated to 1.19.8

Fleet has updated Go to 1.19.8 in light of Goâ€™s [crypto/elliptic](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/58647) fix. While this only affected niche configurations with very specific direct uses of crypto/elliptic, Fleet does not make any special use of crypto/elliptic, but Fleet takes ðŸŸ  Ownership of the tools we use and ensures they are kept up to date.

## More new features, improvements, and bug fixes

- Added the `fleetctl mdm run-command` command, to run any of the [Apple-supported MDM commands](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicemanagement/commands_and_queries) on a host.
- Added the `fleetctl get mdm-command-results` sub-command to get the results for a previously-executed MDM command.
