| Extension Attribute            | Query or Policy        | Depending on your use case, a query is similar to an Extension Attribute used to gather specific information from a device. Similarly, a policy is used to return a boolean (Yes/No or True/False) response about a device.                                                                |

Where a Site is typically based on location or division of administrative oversight, a team can be based on this or other attributes that fit your needs like device baselines, test devices, hardware types, etc.  |
