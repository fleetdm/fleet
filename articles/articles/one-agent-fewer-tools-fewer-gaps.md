### One agent. Fewer tools. Fewer gaps.

Managing devices and vulnerabilities shouldn't mean installing two different agents‚Äîor paying for two different platforms.  
With Fleet, your security team and IT team can work together on the same source of truth.  
Fleet brings MDM and vulnerability management into one console, using one lightweight agent.

---

## Why this way?

- No separate agent for MDM, vulnerability management, and telemetry  
- No silos between device visibility and vulnerability response  
- No extra overhead for teams that manage Macs, Windows, and Linux  

---

## The Problem: Double the Agents, Double the Headaches

Talk to most IT teams today and you'll find a familiar pattern:  
One team manages devices with an MDM solution. Another team scans for vulnerabilities with a separate security tool.  
Each system requires its own agent installation, its own maintenance cycle, its own slice of system resources‚Äîand its own SMEs.

This approach creates predictable friction:

- When a critical vulnerability surfaces, security teams scramble to identify affected devices  
- IT teams work separately to push patches  
- The two datasets rarely align perfectly, leading to gaps in coverage and duplicated effort  
- Both agents collect overlapping info‚Äîwasting bandwidth, processing power, and engineering time  

For orgs running mixed environments (macOS, Windows, Linux), the complexity multiplies.  
Different platforms often require different tools, creating a patchwork of solutions that's expensive to maintain and hard to coordinate.

## Clear the Thicket üåæ

Fleet eliminates this duplication **by design**.

The same `fleetd` agent powers MDM, deploys software, runs queries, and surfaces known vulnerabilities, available patches, and out-of-date software‚Äîacross all your endpoints.

<!-- Consider reworking the above paragraph, as noted. Here's a lighter option:
The `fleetd` agent isn't just for one job. It‚Äôs your device manager, vulnerability scanner, software deployer, and inventory system‚Äîall in one. -->

This unified approach transforms how IT and security teams collaborate:

- No more ‚Äúreach across the aisle‚Äù syncs
- Both teams operate from the same real-time dataset
- When a new vulnerability emerges, security sees which devices are affected **and** IT deploys the fix‚Äîall in one flow
- Patch deployment integrates into the same system already managing your devices  

Teams spend **less time gathering and correlating**, and **more time securing and managing** devices.  
Isn‚Äôt that the goal?

## Built for Modern IT Teams

Fleet understands that modern IT teams need **flexibility**, not lock-in.

Whether you're:

- Running GitOps workflows  
- Managing air-gapped environments  
- Supporting remote teams across time zones  

Fleet gives you the openness to adapt to how your team actually works.

Because Fleet is built on open source foundations, you maintain **complete visibility** into:

- What data is collected  
- How it's processed  
- How it flows into your security and IT tools  

You can write custom queries, fine-tune data collection, and export results into the systems your teams already rely on.

<!-- Keep this? If your audience is compliance/security folks, it's relevant. Otherwise, could cut or condense. -->

This is especially valuable for **compliance-focused organizations**:

- Audit what Fleet collects  
- Modify queries to meet regulatory requirements  
- Align vuln management with internal security policies‚Äîno black-box behavior required

## Beyond Apple: True Cross-Platform Management

Your org likely runs a mix of macOS, Windows, and Linux.  
Each of these platforms often gets its own management tool, which leads to:

- Administrative overhead  
- Security blind spots  
- Fragmented reporting  

With Fleet, those silos disappear.

- One policy engine  
- One query language  
- One vulnerability view  

IT teams work from a **single clean interface**, security monitors **one dashboard**, and executives see **unified reporting**.

<!-- Reworked from the original suggestion you didn‚Äôt like. Let me know if you want a more informal tone. -->

This also benefits orgs with hybrid cloud or BYOD strategies‚Äîsupport the tools your people actually use, without sacrificing security or control.

---

## An Implementation Simpler Than You Think ü™ü

Deploying Fleet doesn't require a rip-and-replace.  
It installs **alongside your existing tools**, so you can:

- Start with data collection and basic vuln management  
- Add MDM and software deployment when your team is ready  
- Move at your own pace while gaining immediate visibility benefits  

Fleet is a good neighbor‚Äîgradually replacing complexity with control, and chaos with clarity.

---

## Ready to Simplify?

The choice between managing multiple agents or adopting a unified approach isn‚Äôt just about saving money‚Äîit‚Äôs about helping your IT and security teams **work better together**.

Fleet provides the foundation for this collaboration by eliminating artificial barriers between device management and vulnerability response.
