## Challenge

A prominent financial services company encountered substantial challenges with its existing device management solution. The platform demanded excessive resources and time for maintenance while limiting its ability to implement automated GitOps workflows, a focus of its operational strategy. The previous migration experience had been arduous, needing to support a fleet comprising 2,700 devices across macOS, Windows, and iOS devices. They required a scalable and secure platform that could support its configuration-as-code philosophy and reallocate resources to more strategic initiatives.

## Solution

They selected Fleet as its new device management platform to unify its device ecosystem. Fleet's next-gen GitOps capabilities aligned with their commitment to configuration as code, enabling seamless integration with their existing automation workflows. Fleet's support and direct database schema [migration tool](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/blob/d563d09baca642d5e4f910759b71619333b500b9/tools/mdm/migration/micromdm/touchless/README.md) facilitated the migration process, ensuring a smooth transition. Additionally, [Fleet's open API](https://fleetdm.com/docs/rest-api/rest-api) and advanced features, such as live query execution, real-time insights, and configurable logging pipelines, provide their teams with real-time visibility and control over their endpoints.
