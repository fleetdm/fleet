### Expand identity provider (IdP) foreign vitals

Fleet now supports using end users’ IdP department info in [configuration profile variables](TODO). This allows IT admins to deploy a [property list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_list) (via configuration profile) so that third-party tools (i.e. Munki) can automate actions based on department data.
