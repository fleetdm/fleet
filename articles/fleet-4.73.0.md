### Linux OS vulnerabilities

See and prioritize vulnerabilities in Linux operating systems, not just software packages. This gives you a fuller picture of risk across your environment. Learn more about [vulnerability detection in Fleet](https://fleetdm.com/guides/vulnerability-processing).

### Custom severity (CVSS) filters

Filter software by a custom severity (CVSS base score) range, like CVSS â‰¥ 7.5, to focus on what matters to your security team.

### Schedue scripts

TODO

### Linux software usage

See the last time a Linux app was opened. Optimize license spend by identifying unused software.

### BitLocker PIN enforcement

TODO

### Enroll BYOD with IdP authentication

TODO

### Custom variables in scripts and configuration profiles

TODO

### Windows configuration profile variable: UUID

Use Fleet's new built-in `$FLEET_VAR_HOST_UUID` variable in your Windows configuration profiles to help deploy unqiue certificates to connect hosts to third-party tools like Okta Verify. See other built-in variables in Fleet's [YAML reference docs](https://fleetdm.com/docs/configuration/yaml-files#macos-settings-and-windows-settings).
