# Journalism nonprofit manages Mac and Linux devices with GitOps

An independent journalism nonprofit that builds infrastructure for independent journalism and manages a remote-first fleet of macOS and Linux devices required a developer-centric tool that aligned with their open-source values.

## At a glance

- **Endpoints:** ~39 (Mac and Linux).  
- **Primary requirement:** open-source core and GitOps capabilities.  
- **Key integrations:** osquery, internal team dashboards.  
- **Previous solution:** traditional "black-box" MDMs.  

## The challenge

Traditional MDMs felt like "black boxes" that were misaligned with their mission. They specifically struggled with maintaining consistent visibility into Linux workstations.

## The solution

They chose Fleet for its ability to treat Linux and macOS with equal visibility via osquery. They manage their device state via version-controlled repositories (GitOps), which allows them to stay lean.

## The results

- **Invisible transition:** the migration was nearly invisible to users, leveraging declarative configurations to manage states without disruption.  
- **Transparent metrics:** device compliance status is synced directly to internal team dashboards via the API.  
- **Live Posture checks:** the team can run live queries across the entire foundation to confirm security status in seconds.

## About Fleet

Our API-first approach empowers technical teams to automate with GitOps, scale confidently, and get the real-time data needed to secure their entire macOS, iOS, Windows, and Linux fleets.
