### Show notes: 

In his day job, Mat X serves the local film, visual effects (VFX), and media production industries. As an established storage, workflow, and backup expert, he builds better workflows from camera to archive and back again.

Working with high speed fiber channel SAN storage led to a healthy respect for well established backup, archive, and disaster recovery systems — balancing on-premises linear tape open (LTO) systems that offer fast and secure cloud backups.

Many years of managing Macs and other devices has created a large community of IT professionals wanting to do the same. Mat X saw the new trend of Mac open-source software written through collaboration. He wanted to focus on the niche of developers (Dev) and IT (Ops) working together, so he founded a new conference called MacDevOps:YVR (MDO:YVR for short).

In 2015, IT, system administration, programming, and DevOps professionals from all over the world gathered in Vancouver (YVR) for the first MDO annual conference. Knowing that more storage and services were moving to the cloud — and that writing software collaboratively was a necessary learning goal for many — Mat X created MDO as a way forward to build a better community.
