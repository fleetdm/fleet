# All-in-one IT platform provider

## AI-driven IT management powered by Fleet

An all-in-one platform for identity, MDM, and procurement. They needed a programmable layer to serve as the "secret weapon" for their own automated services.

## At a glance

- **Endpoints:** Thousands across managed accounts  
- **Primary Requirement:** Robust API and patch management automation.  
- **Key Integrations:** Brew and Winget.  
- **Previous Solution:** Manual, "point-and-click" workflows.  

## The Challenge: Cross-platform Remediation

Managing cross-platform patches and verifying device states in real-time was a significant hurdle before integrating Fleet.

## The Solution: Programmable Layer

They chose Fleet for its deep GitOps integration, allowing them to build their own automation and patching logic on a secure, auditable foundation. They utilize a unified system to manage Mac, Windows, and Linux via tools like Brew and Winget.

## The Results: Proactive Posture

- **Automated App Patching:** Using the API, they programmatically updates fleet-maintained apps via GitOps.  
- **Consolidated Stack:** Consolidation allowed them to replace 4+ legacy tools with one system, reducing vendor sprawl.  
- **AI-Driven Insights:** Real-time telemetry is fed into their own orchestration engine to proactively detect and remediate issues.
