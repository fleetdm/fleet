# Automatic Installation for Fleet-Maintained Apps

Fleet can now help simplify software deployment for IT admins with automatic installation of
Fleet-maintained apps. This update eliminates the need for manual installation on individual hosts,
saving time and effort when deploying new software across your organization. Here's how it works:

1. **Select the App:** Navigate to the **Software** page and click the "Add software". Then choose
   the **Fleet-maintained** section and select the desired Fleet-maintained app (e.g., Notion).
2. **Choose Installation Method:** You'll now see a new option: an **Install** section with "Manual" and "Automatic" options. Selecting "Automatic" will create a policy to automatically install the app on hosts that don't currently have it.
3. **Add Software:** Click "Add Software" to initiate the automatic installation process.

## Key Benefits

* **Simplified Deployment:** Deploy apps to multiple hosts with a single click, eliminating manual installation on each machine.
* **Automated Policy Creation:** The system automatically creates the necessary policy to manage the installations, removing the need for manual policy creation.
* **Automatic Reinstallation:** If a user uninstalls the app, the policy will automatically reinstall it on the next policy run, ensuring consistent deployment.
* **Clear Visibility:** A badge on the app listing indicates which apps are configured for automatic installation. The app's details page also clearly states its automatic installation status and provides a link to the associated policy.

## How to Manage Automatic Installations

* **View Policies:** Clicking on the automatic installation indicator on the app details page will
  take you to the relevant policy's details view. You can also find the policy listed on the **Policies** page under the relevant team.
* **Monitor Installation Status:** Fleet provides real-time feedback on the installation process.
  You can monitor the installation status on the **Host Details** page under the "Activity" section, which shows queued installations and
  any potential failures.
* **Prevent Accidental Deletion:** If you attempt to delete an app that has an automatic
  installation policy associated with it, the system will prevent the deletion until the policy is
  removed. This prevents accidental disruption of app deployments.

## Important Considerations

**GitOps Compatibility:** Currently, Fleet-maintained apps are not fully compatible with GitOps. This means these automatically generated policies will be affected by GitOps runs. We are working on improving GitOps support for Fleet-maintained apps in future releases. For now, using uploaded packages and VPP is the recommended approach for GitOps workflows.

This new feature simplifies app deployment, saving you time and ensuring consistent application
availability across your organization. We encourage you to try it out and reach out to us with any feedback.
