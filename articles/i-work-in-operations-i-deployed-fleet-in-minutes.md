# I work in operations. I deployed Fleet in minutes.

As someone who spends most of his days in contracts, Vanta, or onboarding new hires, deploying software wasn’t something I expected to do or, frankly, ever needed to. But recently, I deployed Fleet on Render, and the process was so intuitive and fast that I barely noticed the learning curve.

Besides succeeding on my first attempt, what surprised me most was how little friction there was getting from “zero” to “live.” No server wrangling, no manual configuration, just clear documentation and a few guided steps. The initial setup took about five minutes.

## Self-hosting, simplified

I’ve always viewed self-hosting as a space reserved for more technical roles. But Fleet makes that boundary feel a lot thinner. The deployment process was clean, well-documented, and built to remove unnecessary complexity. I followed the steps, clicked through the setup, and the application was up and running with no guesswork, no endless tweaking, and no groaning through a long troubleshooting process because something didn’t go as planned.

I assumed I would need to spin up servers from scratch, learn about Docker, configure a bunch of files by hand, and spend hours combing through cryptic logs or lines of code trying to figure out what went wrong, something I hadn’t done since using HTML to customize my MySpace page circa 2005. Fleet wasn’t like that.

The docs were short and clear. There was nothing tricky to figure out. I followed the steps, clicked a few buttons, and — Eureka! Just like Victor Frankenstein, I watched it go live.

## A one-click upgrade experience

Later, I found the upgrade process even simpler than the initial deployment. I’d be lying to you if I said I knew exactly what’s involved in a database migration, but I can tell you that it was baked into the upgrade process and happened with the click of a button. There were no interruptions, no hidden tasks, just an updated instance, ready to go. I don’t know that anything gets easier than that.

## Why this matters

For people in operations, legal, HR, or other non-engineering roles, the idea of deploying or managing an app can seem like someone else’s domain. But tools like Fleet make technical ownership more accessible. It doesn’t require deep technical fluency, just a willingness to follow clear steps and trust the process.

Fleet supports on-prem use cases and always will. That includes people who are new to it or less familiar with this type of technology in general. This kind of experience opens the door for broader collaboration and in a remote, cross-functional world, that kind of accessibility isn’t just empowering - it’s necessary.
