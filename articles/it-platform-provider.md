# IT platform provider automates patching across thousands of Mac, Windows, and Linux devices

An all-in-one platform for identity, MDM, and procurement needed a programmable layer to serve as the "secret weapon" for their own automated services.

## At a glance

- **Endpoints:** thousands across managed accounts  
- **Primary requirement:** robust API and patch management automation.  
- **Key integrations:** Brew and Winget.  
- **Previous solution:** manual, "point-and-click" workflows.  

## The challenge

Managing cross-platform patches and verifying device states in real-time was a significant hurdle before integrating Fleet.

## The solution

They chose Fleet for its deep GitOps integration, allowing them to build their own automation and patching logic on a secure, auditable foundation. They utilize a unified system to manage Mac, Windows, and Linux via tools like Brew and Winget.

## The results

- **Automated app patching:** Using the API, they programmatically updates fleet-maintained apps via GitOps.  
- **Consolidated stack:** Consolidation allowed them to replace 4+ legacy tools with one system, reducing vendor sprawl.  
- **AI-driven insights:** Real-time telemetry is fed into their own orchestration engine to proactively detect and remediate issues.
