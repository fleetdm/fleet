# Windows & Linux setup experience

_Available in Fleet Premium_

In Fleet, you can customize the software that's installed when a new Windows and Linux workstations enroll to Fleet.

Fleet automatically opens the default web browser to show end users software install progress:

The browser can be closed, and the installation will continue in the background. End users can return to the setup experience page by clicking **My Device** from Fleet Desktop.  Once all steps have completed, the **My Device** page will show the host information as usual.

If software installs fail, Fleet automatically retries. Learn more in the [macOS setup experience guide](https://fleetdm.com/guides/macos-setup-experience#install-software).

To replace the Fleet logo with your organization's logo:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Organization settings** > **Organization info**
2. Add URLs to your logos in the **Organization avatar URL (for dark backgrounds)** and **Organization avatar URL (for light backgrounds)** fields
3. Press **Save**

> See [configuration documentation](https://fleetdm.com/docs/configuration/yaml-files#org-info) for recommended logo sizes.

> Software installations during setup experience are automatically attempted up to 3 times (1 initial attempt + 2 retries) to handle intermittent network issues or temporary failures. This ensures a more reliable setup process for end users.

1. Click on the **Controls** tab in the main navigation bar,  then **Setup experience** > **3. Install software**.
