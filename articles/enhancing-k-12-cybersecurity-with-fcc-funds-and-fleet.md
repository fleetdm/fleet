The digital landscape in K-12 education is evolving rapidly, and with this transformation comes the critical need to safeguard school networks and data. The new [Federal Communications Commission (FCC) schools and libraries cybersecurity pilot program](https://www.fcc.gov/cybersecurity-pilot-program) offers a significant opportunity for schools to enhance their cybersecurity infrastructure. One of the most effective ways to utilize these funds is by investing in Fleet, an open-source endpoint visibility platform designed to improve endpoint protection, identity protection and authentication, and monitoring, detection, and response.


## A real threat

Did you know that [K-12 schools are now the top target for ransomware attacks](https://www.forbes.com/sites/frederickhess/2023/09/20/the-top-target-for-ransomware-its-now-k-12-schools/)? This startling reality is impacting educational institutions nationwide. Imagine a typical school day disrupted by a malicious cyber attack, compromising sensitive student and staff data. This is not just a hypothetical scenario; it’s happening more frequently than ever before. 

For instance, in a recent incident covered by [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/03/11/1236995412/cybersecurity-hackers-schools-ransomware), a school district in Toledo, Ohio, was paralyzed by a ransomware attack that locked teachers out of their computers and halted online classes for over a week. This real-world example underscores the urgency of bolstering cybersecurity measures. That's why the FCC's new cybersecurity pilot program couldn't have arrived sooner.


## Endpoint protection

Endpoint protection is paramount in a school environment where numerous devices connect to the network daily. Fleet provides comprehensive endpoint security by ensuring all devices are accounted for and secure. Schools can deploy Fleet to monitor laptops, desktops, and mobile devices used by students, teachers, and administrative staff. This visibility allows security teams to detect and mitigate threats in real time, preventing potential breaches. Software vulnerabilities are captured and prioritized for remediation using multiple popular scoring mechanisms. Fleet’s MDM (Mobile Device Management) features can remediate the highest-risk vulnerabilities. FCC funds can cover the costs of deploying and maintaining Fleet, ensuring that all endpoints are continuously monitored and protected against malicious activities.


## Identity protection and authentication

Identity protection and authentication are crucial in preventing unauthorized access to sensitive information. Fleet integrates seamlessly with existing identity management systems to enhance security measures. By using Fleet, schools can implement zero trust architectures leveraging Fleet’s device health capabilities leverage osquery. This integration ensures that only devices with approved security postures can access the school’s network and resources. With financial support from the FCC program, schools can invest in the necessary infrastructure to support these advanced authentication methods, thereby significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized access.


## Monitoring, detection, and response

Effective cybersecurity is about prevention and the ability to monitor, detect, and respond to incidents swiftly. Fleet excels in providing real-time monitoring and detection capabilities. It enables security teams to set up alerts for suspicious activities and promptly investigate potential threats. This proactive approach is essential for minimizing the impact of security incidents. The FCC funds can be allocated to train staff to use Fleet’s features effectively and establish a robust detection platform and incident response plan. This ensures that schools are not only protected but are also prepared to handle cybersecurity incidents efficiently.


## Applying

Eligible schools, libraries, and consortia should follow a two-part application process to apply for the FCC Schools and Libraries Cybersecurity Pilot Program, which will be opened by the FCC this Fall, 2024. First, applicants submit general information and details about the proposed cybersecurity project. Second, selected participants provide more detailed cybersecurity information. The FCC will announce selected participants via a public notice, who will then proceed with competitive bidding and reimbursement requests. For detailed instructions, visit the [FCC Cybersecurity Pilot Program page](https://www.fcc.gov/cybersecurity-pilot-program).


## Conclusion

The FCC Schools and Libraries Cybersecurity Pilot Program is a game-changer for K-12 schools looking to bolster their cybersecurity defenses. By investing in Fleet, schools can achieve comprehensive endpoint protection, enhance identity protection and authentication, and improve their monitoring, detection, and response capabilities. This strategic use of funds will ensure that schools can provide a safe and secure digital learning environment for all students and staff, safeguarding their data and maintaining the integrity of their educational programs.
