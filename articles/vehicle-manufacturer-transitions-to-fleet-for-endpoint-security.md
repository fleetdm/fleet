## Challenge

A leading electric vehicle manufacturer was experiencing rapid growth that strained its existing IT and security infrastructure. Managing an expanding and unique fleet of endpoints within on-premise systems presented significant challenges. Their current solution was falling short in providing real-time data on their assets and enabling a more efficient vulnerability management program.

## Solution 

They purchased Fleet as a replacement for their existing solution to reduce manual work and foster collaboration with their cybersecurity teams. Fleet offered visibility into their endpoints with real-time data, automated reporting, and robust vulnerability management capabilities.

## Results

By switching to Fleet, they gained a centralized platform that significantly improved its ability to monitor and manage critical security processes. While new automations allowed them to proactively address and prioritize uncovered vulnerabilities that actually matter. The solution also facilitated better collaboration within their cybersecurity teams and ensured compliance across all devices, both within and outside the cloud environments.


## Their story

The leading electric vehicle manufacturer was experiencing rapid growth that strained its existing IT and security infrastructure. Managing a diverse and expanding fleet of endpoints across various environments presented significant challenges. Their current solution was failing to provide effective asset management and, at one point, even brought their production line to a halt.

To address these challenges, they set out to achieve four key goals:

- Gain real-time visibility into their endpoints.

- Institute proactive vulnerability management.

- Report on automated remediation efforts.

- Integrate and surface data across teams.


### Real-time visibility

Security is a data problem. We felt confident being able to know what we wanted to look for. We just needed the data and a platform to go and get it. With the hope of really pinpointing, these were the issues, these were not, and ignore the rest of the noise.

Fleet enables comprehensive monitoring and management by communicating with online devices in real-time. It delivers chip-level data insights that surface critical information, ensuring they can maintain a secure and efficient operational environment. Additionally, Fleetâ€™s query engine and open API enable them to create custom detections for zero-day threats, increasing their ability to identify and respond to emerging vulnerabilities swiftly.

### Proactive Vulnerability Management

By ensuring automated patch compliance and timely vulnerability mitigation, Fleet significantly reduces the risk of security breaches and keeps all systems consistently within pre-configured policies. This proactive approach not only compacts a typically lengthy vulnerability management process but also ensures continuous protection and risk reduction.

### Automating processes and day-to-day reporting

Fleet is built for automation, reducing the manual workload of routine tasks such as software installations, updates, and vulnerability mitigations from its IT and cybersecurity teams.
Integrating with their existing tools like Torq, made it easier to generate accurate and timely reports on day-to-day security, including the ongoing status of vulnerabilities and remediation efforts.

### Definitive data

By adhering to standard data shapes and formats, Fleet makes sure that data is easily interpretable and usable across various teams and applications. While serving as the central hub for security data, it provides a single source of truth that enhances the precision and efficiency of its asset inventory.

## Conclusion

The decision to purchase Fleet was driven by the need for a more reliable, comprehensive, visible, and collaborative solution that could effectively replace their existing platform. Fleet's real-time data access, vulnerability management, and automation helped achieve these objectives. By adopting Fleet, they were able to pinpoint their security issues, prioritize what actually mattered, and proactively manage and mitigate threats while saving time.
