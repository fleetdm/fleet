## Highlights
* Improved end-user MDM migration
* Enforce minimum OS version for MDM enrollment
* Exact match CVE search
* Software vulnerabilities severity filter
* Self-service VPP apps
* Multiple ABM and VPP support


### Improved end-user MDM migration

Fleet has improved the end-user MDM migration workflow on macOS by enabling the migration of hosts manually enrolled in a third-party MDM over to Fleet MDM using the Fleet Desktop application. Previously, this capability was limited to hosts enrolled through Apple's Automated Device Enrollment (ADE), but with this update, manually enrolled hosts can now be seamlessly migrated to Fleet MDM. This feature is specifically available for macOS Sonoma devices (macOS 14 or greater). It makes the migration process more flexible and accessible for organizations looking to centralize their MDM management under Fleet. This enhancement simplifies the transition to Fleet MDM for a broader range of macOS devices, ensuring that all hosts can be managed consistently and securely.


### Enforce minimum OS version for MDM enrollment

Fleet now enforces a minimum operating system (OS) requirement for macOS devices before they can be enrolled into Fleet's MDM. This feature ensures that only devices running a specified minimum macOS version can be enrolled, helping organizations maintain a consistent security and compliance baseline across their fleet. By setting a minimum OS requirement, Fleet prevents older, potentially less secure macOS versions from being managed under its MDM, thereby reducing vulnerabilities and ensuring all enrolled devices meet the organization's standards. This update enhances Fleet's ability to enforce security policies from the outset, ensuring that all devices in the fleet are up-to-date and capable of supporting the latest security and management features.


### Exact match CVE search

Fleet has enhanced its CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) search functionality by introducing exact match searching, allowing users to quickly and accurately find specific vulnerabilities across their fleet. This improvement ensures that security teams can pinpoint the exact CVE they are investigating without sifting through irrelevant results, streamlining the vulnerability management process. Additionally, Fleet provides better context in cases where no results are found, helping users understand why a particular CVE might not be present in their environment. This update improves the overall user experience in vulnerability management, making it easier to maintain security and compliance across all managed devices.


### Software vulnerabilities severity filter

Fleet has introduced improved filtering capabilities for vulnerable software, allowing users to filter vulnerabilities by severity level. This enhancement enables security teams to prioritize their response efforts by focusing on the most critical vulnerabilities, ensuring that the highest-risk issues are promptly addressed. By providing a straightforward and efficient way to filter vulnerable software based on severity, Fleet helps organizations streamline their vulnerability management processes, reducing the risk of security incidents. This update aligns with Fleet's commitment to providing powerful tools that enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of security operations across all managed devices.


### Self-Service Apple App Store apps

Fleet enables organizations to assign and install Apple App Store apps purchased through the Volume Purchase Program (VPP) directly via Self-Service using Fleet Desktop. This new feature allows IT administrators to make VPP-purchased apps available to end users seamlessly and flexibly. By integrating VPP app distribution into the Fleet Desktop Self-Service portal, organizations can streamline the deployment of essential software across their macOS devices, ensuring that users have easy access to the tools they need while maintaining control over software distribution. This update enhances the overall user experience and operational efficiency, empowering end users to install approved applications with minimal IT intervention.


### Multiple Apple Business Manager and VPP support

Fleet now enables administrators to add and manage multiple Apple Business Manager (ABM) and Volume Purchase Program (VPP) tokens within a single Fleet instance. This feature is designed for both Managed Service Providers (MSPs) and large enterprises, allowing them to create separate automatic enrollment and App Store app workflows for different clients or divisions, each with their own ABM and VPP tokens. Whether youâ€™re managing devices for multiple customers or supporting large organizations with distinct divisions, this update simplifies the process of handling macOS, iOS, and iPadOS devices. With support for multiple ABM and VPP connections, Fleet streamlines software and device management across varied environments, providing a scalable solution for both MSPs and enterprises looking to centralize control while maintaining flexibility for different user groups.


## Changes

**NOTE:** Beginning with Fleet v4.55.0, Fleet no longer supports MySQL 5.7 because it has reached [end of life](https://mattermost.com/blog/mysql-5-7-reached-eol-upgrade-to-mysql-8-x-today/#:~:text=In%20October%202023%2C%20MySQL%205.7,to%20upgrade%20to%20MySQL%208.). The minimum version supported is MySQL 8.0.36.

## Fleet 4.56.0 (Sep 7, 2024)

- Added a disabled overlay to the Other Workflows modal on the policy page.
- Improved performance of live queries to accommodate for higher volumes when utilizing zero-trust workflows.

### Device management

- Added server support for multiple VPP tokens.
- Added new endpoints and updated existing endpoints for managing multiple Apple Business Manager tokens.
- Added support for S3 to store MDM bootstrap packages (uses the same bucket configuration as for software installers).
- Added support to UI for self service VPP software.
- Added backend and gitops support for self service VPP.

- Updated the instructions on "My device" for MDM migrations on pre-Sonoma macOS hosts.
- Updated to allow multiple teams to be assigned to the same VPP Token.
- Updated process so that deleting installed software or VPP app now makes it available for re-installation.
- Updated to enforce minimum OS version settings during Apple Automated Device Enrollment (ADE).
- Updated ABM ingestion so that deleted iOS/iPadOS host will continue to report to Fleet as long as host is in Apple Business Manager (ABM).
- Updated so that refetching an offline iOS/iPadOS host will not add new MDM commands to the queue if previous refetch has not completed yet.

- Added the following filters to `/software/titles` and `/software/versions` API endpoints: `exploit: bool`, `min_cvss_score: float`, `max_cvss_score: float`.
- Updated software titles/versions tables to allow for filtering by vulnerabilities including severity and known exploit.

- Fixed the "Available for install" filter in the host's software page so that installers that were requested to be installed on the host (regardless of installation status) also show up in the list.
- Fixed UI popup messages bleeding off viewport in some cases.
- Fixed an issue with the scheduling of cron jobs at startup if the job has never run, which caused it to be delayed.
