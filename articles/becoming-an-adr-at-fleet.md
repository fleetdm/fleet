# Becoming an ADR (Account Development Representative) at Fleet. A look at what I've learned.

Before joining Fleet, I worked at [Amazon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)) as a transportation manager. My world revolved around numbers: efficiency metrics, delivery times, and cost savings. I assumed marketing worked the same way, just another numbers game. The bigger the audience we market to, the more leads, deals, and meetings. It felt like a straightforward equation.
But once I landed at Fleet, I realized something important: more eyes doesn’t always mean more impact.


## From Broad Reach to Real Relevance

At the start, we were still figuring out how to be more targeted with our outreach. The more we talked with engineers, the very people we’re building Fleet for, the more we learned. Those conversations helped us focus, dive deeper, and connect with folks who can actually benefit from what Fleet offers.
And that shift? It’s made all the difference. It’s helped us build stronger relationships, and it’s created a clearer sense that the work we’re doing actually matters.

## What We Started Doing Differently

Coming into this role, I had to unlearn a lot of traditional habits. Instead of playing the numbers game, we embraced a different approach. One rooted in Fleet’s values of [openness, transparency, and trust](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/why-this-way#why-open-source) through context.


## Here’s what that looked like in practice:

**Finding the right people** – We don't try to talk to everyone. Instead, we focus on reaching the people and companies that would actually benefit from Fleet.

**Talking about what actually matters** – Generic marketing messages don’t cut it. Engineers care about solving problems and improving their workflows, so that’s what we talked about.

**Quality over quantity** – More outreach didn’t mean better results. We put our energy into real, meaningful conversations with the right people.

**Learning through trial and error** – Since this was my first marketing role, I leaned into Fleet’s culture of defaulting to openness. I shared what I didn’t know, took feedback seriously, and learned by doing.


## What’s Been Working

This [values-driven approach](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company#values) has paid off in big ways:

**We’re reaching the right people** – No more guesswork. We’re connecting with folks who could actually benefit from Fleet.

**We’re showing real value** – Instead of just saying, “Here’s what Fleet does,” we’re showing how Fleet makes their jobs easier and their companies stronger.

**We’re building real connections** – No more robotic sales pitches. Just honest conversations about real problems.

**I’m learning more every day** – Marketing isn’t just about tactics. It’s about understanding people and that’s what makes it both challenging and rewarding.


## How This Has Changed My Outlook

This experience has completely reshaped how I think about marketing. It’s no longer about outdated “spray and pray” tactics. It’s about:

**Relevance** – Making sure what you’re saying actually resonates with the right people.

**Meaningful engagement** – Prioritizing quality over volume in every interaction.

**Long-term relationships** – Thinking beyond the sale and focusing on building partnerships.

**Always learning** – Embracing experimentation and continuous improvement.


## Why This Matters

At the end of the day, it’s about working smarter, not harder. By focusing on the right audience, having real conversations, and actually helping people, we’ve seen better results and it’s simply a more enjoyable and sustainable way to do marketing.

One of the most rewarding parts has been hearing feedback like this:

“Something I really appreciate about working with you guys is that it doesn't feel like I'm talking to a vendor. It actually feels like I'm talking to my team, and I really appreciate it.”

**— Partner - Cyber and Strategic Risk**
</div>

That kind of response reinforces that we’re on the right track building real relationships, staying open, and continuously improving based on what actually matters to the people we serve.

This shift in strategy has led to more meaningful conversations and better outcomes. It’s been a valuable learning experience, and I’m excited to keep refining it.
