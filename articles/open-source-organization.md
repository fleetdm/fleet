# Open-source organization manages 1,556 devices with real-time compliance

A global open-source software organization managing a fleet of over 1,500 devices required a solution that respected privacy and offered equal depth for Mac, Windows, and Linux.

## At a glance

- **Endpoints:** 1,556 (Mac, Windows, and Linux).  
- **Primary requirement:** True multi-OS support and open-source core.  
- **Key integrations:** Splunk and Google BigQuery.  
- **Previous solution:** Legacy tools that treated Linux as a "second-class citizen".  

## The challenge:

The team lacked a unified solution for remote wipe and deep logging across their diverse OS environment. Linux servers and BYOD units were major blind spots with limited compliance visibility.

## The solution

Fleet’s open-source nature aligned with their organizational values, easing cultural acceptance and reducing pushback on MDM adoption. They used GitOps and osquery to implement real-time compliance checks as code.

## The results

- **Minutes vs. days:** Response times to new vulnerabilities shifted from days to minutes through real-time visibility and targeted patching.  
- **Automated reporting:** The team uses the API to programmatically track fleet-maintained app versions and patch compliance.  
- **Unified ecosystem:** Streaming telemetry into Splunk and BigQuery allowed them to correlate endpoint events with broader infrastructure logs.
