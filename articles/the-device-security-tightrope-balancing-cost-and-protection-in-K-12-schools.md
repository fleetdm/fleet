In today's digital classrooms, the diversity of devices and operating systems—from Macs and Windows to Linux and Chromebooks—presents unique challenges for K-12 schools. As technology becomes increasingly integral to education, the complexity of managing cybersecurity risks grows. The task is daunting: ensuring robust protection against cyber threats while grappling with limited budgets and IT resources. In August 2023, the [U.S. Department of Education highlighted these challenges](https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/department-of-education-announces-k-12-cybersecurity-resilience-efforts), emphasizing the need for schools to balance cost with effective cybersecurity measures. This blog post delves into the evolving landscape of digital education, exploring strategies for K-12 schools to navigate the precarious balance between securing their digital infrastructure and managing costs efficiently. Drawing on recent governmental efforts and expert insights, we'll outline actionable steps to lead to a more secure and enriching learning environment for all.


## The growing cybersecurity challenge in education

In August 2023 U.S. Department of Education posted a press release, “[Key K-12 Cybersecurity Resilience Efforts](https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/department-of-education-announces-k-12-cybersecurity-resilience-efforts),” discussing the growing security challenges for educational institutions. U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona is quoted as saying, 

<blockquote purpose="large-quote">Let’s face it: in today’s digital age, our students and their teachers will increasingly use technology in the classroom. Schools have access to more devices and connectivity than ever before, and this technology in education has incredible potential to help students better connect with their learning and achieve, and teachers better engage with their students. But to make the most of these benefits, we must effectively manage the risks. Just as we expect everyone in a school system to plan and prepare for physical risks, we must now also ensure everyone helps plan and prepare for digital risks in our schools and classrooms. The Department of Education has listened to the field about the importance of K-12 cybersecurity, and today we are coming together to recognize this and indicate our next steps.

## National attention on cybersecurity in schools

Even the White House is showing concerns.  In August 2023, the White House sponsored The White House’s Back to School Safely: Cybersecurity Summit for K-12 Schools.  They discussed the challenges educators, students, and families face in this increasing number of devices schools have to support, as well as the publication by the Department's Office of Educational Technology and CISA titled "K-12 Digital Infrastructure Brief: Defensible and Resilient." Key considerations include:

 



* **Enhancing continuous risk management:** Addressing the ever-evolving threat landscape by proactively managing cybersecurity risks. 
* **Utilizing analogies for understanding:** Leveraging lessons from physical world scenarios to comprehensively grasp and tackle cybersecurity challenges. 
* **Prioritizing and implementing mitigation strategies:** Identifying the most critical risks and applying effective mitigations such as multi-factor authentication, robust password policies, phishing prevention, and regular software updates. 
* **Building resilience for cyber incidents:** Developing and practicing cyber incident response plans to minimize the impact of potential cybersecurity breaches. 
* **Vendor engagement for enhanced security:** Encouraging vendors to invest in secure design principles, obtain cyber risk assurance certifications, and establish security vulnerability disclosure practices. 


## The overlooked factor: balancing cost and security

Juan Hernandez's article in [The Prey Project in August 2023](https://preyproject.com/blog/device-security-policies-it-schools) discusses why device management is essential for K-12 schools. Hernandez’s article doesn’t address one of the most significant factors, cost. Today K-12 schools struggle with tight budgets, lack of technical resources, and overworked IT and educator staff require school districts to walk a tightrope between cost and risk. Below are a few considerations designed to help schools with this balancing act.


## Strategies for cost-effective cybersecurity in schools



* **Embrace open-source:** Consider open-source solutions for their affordability, agility, and strong community support. 
* **Cost-effectiveness:** Explore solutions that replace redundant, unused tools and avoid vendor lock-in.
* **Converge IT solutions:** Integrate tools and processes into IT operations for a holistic approach.
* **Consolidate and automate tasks:** Integrate and automate IT operations to reduce redundancy and free up staff for strategic initiatives.
* **Prioritize updates:** Act fast on critical patches to minimize vulnerabilities. Be intentional about what you patch. Focus on known exploits and vulnerabilities that exist in your environment first.
* **Implement endpoint protection:** Defend against cyber threats like ransomware to safeguard sensitive data.
* **User education:** Empower users with cybersecurity awareness training and offer transparency about data collection to build trust.


## Additional considerations for a comprehensive approach to cybersecurity



* **Compliance:** Ensure adherence to data privacy regulations like COPPA, FERPA, and GDPR.
* **Continuous adaptation:** Regularly evaluate and adapt your security posture to stay ahead of evolving threats.


## Creating a secure and affordable digital learning environment

In navigating the complex landscape of device security in K-12 schools, it's clear that a balanced approach is not just beneficial; it's necessary. Schools can protect their digital environments by integrating cost-effective strategies with robust cybersecurity measures without straining their budgets. As we've explored, this involves embracing open-source solutions, prioritizing critical updates, and fostering a culture of cybersecurity awareness among all users.

We understand that every school's situation is unique, with its specific challenges and resources. Therefore, we encourage educational institutions to consider and adapt the strategies discussed here to fit their unique circumstances. Implementing these practices may require time and effort, but the payoff in enhanced security and peace of mind is invaluable.
