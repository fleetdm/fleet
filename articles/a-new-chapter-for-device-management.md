# A new chapter for device management

Congratulations to the team at Jamf as they enter a definitive agreement with Francisco Partners to be acquired for $2.2B. This milestone reflects the impact Jamf has had on the Apple ecosystem and community.

## Change brings questions

Acquisitions are exciting, but they often bring change — and real questions.

When ownership shifts, strategic direction and roadmaps often shift as well, so it's natural to ask what that means for innovation, pricing, and support of the tools you rely on. But it's also an opportunity to consider what you really need from your tools today.

## A different way to manage devices

At Fleet, we believe that trust is built through transparency, which is why we work and build in the open.

With Fleet, you can:

- **Own your data:** We make it easy to get data in and out.
- **Audit the code:** You don't have to take our word for it. You can see exactly what the agent is doing.
- **Help shape the product:** Fleet is community driven. We build alongside a community of engineers who use the product every day.

This open model isn't just a philosophy. It's how we ship faster, respond to our users’ needs, and help keep IT and security teams aligned.

## For teams looking ahead

Whether you're a long-time Jamf user or evaluating your options, this is a natural point to consider what else is out there. If you're curious about how Fleet compares, take a look at this [side-by-side](https://fleetdm.com/) comparison. If you decide to make a change, we offer a [free migration program](https://fleetdm.com/articles/free-migration-from-jamf-to-fleet) to help you move from Jamf to Fleet with confidence.

Device management is growing. We're excited to see where the industry goes next — and to keep building our part of it alongside you, in the open.
