# How Fleet raised a $27M Series B without a pitch deck

When Fleet set out to raise its Series B, we skipped the pitch deck. Instead, our CEO, Mike McNeil, took inspiration from [Parker Conrad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parker_Conrad) and wrote a [memo](https://fleetdm.com/pdfs/fleet-series-b-memo.pdf) — a long-form document on market trends, Fleet’s growth, and what’s next.

We still included charts and SaaS metrics like revenue growth, net retention, and sales efficiency. But the heart of the memo was in the writing. Everyone at Fleet had commenter access. We drafted, rewrote, and refined until the story was clear about what we’re building, who it’s for, why now, and how we’ll scale.

That memo helped us raise $27 million. Now that the round is public, we’re sharing it openly for others to learn from.
