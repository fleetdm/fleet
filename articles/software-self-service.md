Fleet’s self-service software feature empowers end users by allowing them to independently install approved software packages from a curated list through the Fleet Desktop “My device” page. This not only reduces the administrative burden on IT teams but also enhances user productivity and satisfaction. In this guide, we will walk you through the process of uploading, editing, and managing self-service software packages in Fleet, enabling seamless software distribution and management.

## Prerequisites

* Fleet Premium is required for software self-service.

> Software packages can be added to a specific team or to the "No team" category. The "No team" category is the default assignment for hosts that are not part of any specific team.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Adding a self-service software package

1. **Navigate to the Software page**: Click “Software” in the main navigation menu.
2. **Select a team**: Click the dropdown in the upper left corner of the page and click on the team to which you want to add the software package.
3. **Open the “Add software” modal**: Click the “Add software” button in the upper right corner of the page.
4. **Select a software package to upload**: Click “Choose file” in the “Add software” modal and select a software package from your computer.
5. **Advanced options**: If desired, click “Advanced options” to add a pre-install condition or post-install script to your software package.
    * **Pre-install condition**: This is an osquery query that results in true. For example, you might require a specific software title to exist before installing additional extensions.
    * **Post-install script**: This might be used to apply a license key, perform configuration tasks, or execute cleanup tasks after the software installation.
6. **Make the software package self-service**: Check the “Self-service” checkbox to mark the software package as self-service.
7. **Finish the upload**: Click the “Add software” button to finish the upload process.
