Osquery gives companies real-time visibility into hundreds of thousands of devices — without having to worry about downtime risks or performance hits. But what can you do with all that data? The organizers of [osquery@scale](https://www.osqueryatscale.com/) went straight to the source for this year’s conference. Zach Wasserman, co-creator of osquery, talked about how to use osquery for vulnerability management at scale.

## Topics discussed

* The importance of vulnerability management
* Osquery as a vulnerability management solution
* Two approaches to vulnerability management with osquery
* How to collect a software inventory for every device
* How to investigate vulnerabilities in real time
* Vulnerability management at scale with osquery
