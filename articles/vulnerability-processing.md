# Vulnerability processing

Vulnerability processing in Fleet detects vulnerabilities (CVEs) for the software installed on your hosts. 

To see what software is covered, check out the [Coverage section](#coverage).

## Coverage

Fleet detects vulnerabilities for these software types:

| Type                | macOS                                      | Windows                                          | Linux                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

As of right now, only app names with all ASCII characters are supported. Apps with names featuring non-ASCII characters, such as Cyrillic, will not generate matches.

For Ubuntu Linux, kernel vulnerabilities with known variants (ie. `-generic`) are detected using OVAL. Custom kernels (unknown variants) are detected using NVD.

## Sources

Fleet combines multiple sources to get accurate and up-to-date CVE information:
- [National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/developers/vulnerabilities) CVE feeds
- [VulnCheck](https://vulncheck.com/) CVE feeds
- [Mac Office release notes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/officeupdates/release-notes-office-for-mac) for Office for Mac
- [Microsoft MSRC Security Bulletins](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide) for Windows OS vulnerabilities
- [OVAL definitions](https://github.com/fleetdm/nvd/blob/master/oval_sources.json) for Linux software

## Advanced configuration

Fleet runs vulnerability downloading and processing via internal scheduled cron job. This internal mechanism is very useful
for frictionless deployments and is well suited for most use cases. However, in larger deployments,
where there can be dozens of Fleet server replicas sitting behind a load balancer, it is desirable to manage vulnerability processing externally.

The reasons for this are as follows:

- lower resource requirements across the entire Fleet server deployment (as vulnerability processing requires considerably more resources than just running Fleet server alone)
- more control over scheduling constraints (only process during windows of low utilization, etc.)

It is possible to limit vulnerability processing to a single [dedicated host](https://fleetdm.com/docs/deploying/configuration#current-instance-checks), by setting
`disable_schedule` to `true` but still run one Fleet server as `false`, but the drawback here is still having to dedicate resources
for this single host 24/7. The Fleet binary has a command which handles the same vulnerability processing, but will exit (successfully with 0) on completion. Using this sub-command we can delegate vulnerability processing
to external systems such as:

- [ECS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/scheduling_tasks.html)
- [K8S](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/job/automated-tasks-with-cron-jobs/)
- [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/triggering/using-scheduler#create_job)
- [Plain old cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron)

To opt into this functionality, be sure to configure your Fleet server deployment with

```bash
FLEET_VULNERABILITIES_DISABLE_SCHEDULE=true
```

which will **disable** the internal scheduling mechanism for vulnerability processing.

And then externally run with the same environment variables/configuration files passed to the server
command.
