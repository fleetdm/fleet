# How a global workforce management company achieved compliance and clarity with Fleet—keeping shift work in sync

## Challenge

A global leader in workforce management software needed a reliable way to capture device telemetry, troubleshoot issues, and ensure accurate reporting on OS and software updates to maintain SLA compliance. The increasing number of software applications and browser extensions introduced additional complexity, leading to compliance challenges and gaps across cross-functional teams.

## Solution
The company immediately leveraged Fleet’s robust [API](https://fleetdm.com/docs/rest-api/rest-api) to streamline reporting and enhance visibility across its infrastructure. The engineering team quickly automated reporting processes, delivering regular snapshots of their hosts directly into [Slack](https://slack.com/) channels. This provided security and operations teams with the transparency needed to monitor system health effectively. Using creative solutions, the team built a ‘rolling’ delta to track changes as OS updates were released and patched, enabling real-time updates to security leadership.

By switching to Fleet, the company reduced costs while benefiting from hands-on support and direct access to Fleet’s engineers. They spun up a dedicated Fleet instance on their own managed infrastructure, tailoring configurations and deployments to meet their organization's unique needs.

Fleet provided [real-time visibility](https://fleetdm.com/orchestration) into security posture and operational performance, enabling the IT operations team to proactively address issues and stay ahead of potential risks. Fleet also streamlined processes, enabling the company to maintain consistency and control across its rapidly expanding global device fleet and to support distributed teams with a unified approach to security and compliance. End-user experience remained a priority, and Fleet’s lightweight agent and minimal performance impact enabled deployment quickly and confidently.


## The customer’s story

This fast-growing, globally distributed company needed a centralized platform to provide comprehensive insights into the health and security posture of its operations worldwide. With a growing, diverse workforce, they needed a centralized platform to provide comprehensive insights into the health and security posture of their operations worldwide. By switching to Fleet, the company gained a new level of visibility and control over its devices, enabling it to save time on implementing new processes and proactively managing its fleet.

They achieved this through:

- API-Driven reporting and automation
- Comprehensive device health querying
- Enhanced endpoint visibility
- Flexible deployment options

### API-driven reporting and automation

The company’s engineering team recognized the potential of automating routine compliance and reporting tasks. With Fleet, they streamlined their reporting workflows, enabling quick generation of [compliance](https://fleetdm.com/queries) reports and real-time tracking of device status. This automation significantly reduced manual effort and made it easier to respond to auditor requests for [ISO27001](https://www.iso.org/standard/75652.html) and [SOC2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_and_Organization_Controls) compliance documentation.

### Comprehensive device health querying

With Fleet’s robust osquery capabilities and extensive library of pre-built queries, the team was able to ask questions about a device that was previously unavailable more easily. Engineers could now easily check the status of EDR tools, monitor memory-intensive processes, assess battery health and cycle counts, and much more - enabling them to quickly address issues as soon as they appeared in the helpdesk.

### Enhanced endpoint visibility

For security and trust teams, having visibility into the software and packages installed on every device is essential for proactive security. Fleet’s aggregation of installed software helped the company quickly identify and [mitigate vulnerabilities](https://fleetdm.com/software-management), including high-priority zero-day exploits such as the [XZ Utils issue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XZ_Utils_backdoor), enabling rapid response to threats.

### Flexible deployment options

When evaluating tools, the company wanted the ability to manage its own infrastructure in AWS, ensuring a flexible deployment path that aligned with its infrastructure-as-code approach. This allowed them to right-size their deployment, optimizing costs and resources. The self-hosting option enabled security teams to integrate existing Cloud Security Posture Management tools to detect misconfigurations and continuously monitor cloud resources.


## Conclusion

By switching to Fleet, this global workforce management company gained a powerful, flexible solution that addressed its need for centralized device visibility, streamlined compliance reporting, and proactive security management. Fleet’s robust API, real-time telemetry, and flexible deployment options empowered the team to automate processes, reduce operational overhead, and improve their security posture. With greater insight into their devices, they can confidently support a growing, distributed workforce.
