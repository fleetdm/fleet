# Fleetd authentication

Fleetd is the agent that runs on the endpoints and communicates with Fleet to periodically send device data and to execute management tasks.

The fleetd agent contains three components:
- [orbit](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/tree/main/orbit): This is the main daemon/service that starts all components on the endpoint.
- [osquery](https://github.com/osquery/osquery): Provides the endpoint with SQL-powered instrumentation, monitoring, and analytics.
- [Fleet desktop](https://fleetdm.com/guides/fleet-desktop#basic-article): This is the tray icon app to interface with users of the (Desktop) endpoint. This component can be disabled/missing on some endpoints (e.g. for servers without GUI).

This document aims to explain how all three components authenticate to Fleet servers.

## TLS

All fleetd components communicate to Fleet using HTTPS.

> Fleetd also supports mTLS, more on this below.

## Enrollment to Fleet

Teams in Fleet have an "enroll secret" that is used to authenticate endpoints during enrollment. 

Enroll secrets are generated randomly by Fleet (if not provided) or can be defined by the admin.
The enroll secrets ramdonly generated by Fleet are 24 bytes long, base64 encoded.

### Fleetd package generation

When generating a fleetd package using `fleetctl`, the admin provides an "enroll secret":
```sh
fleetctl package --type=pkg \
    --fleet-desktop \
    --fleet-url=... \
    --enroll-secret=...
```

The "Fleet URL" and "Enroll secret" are embedded into the generated package.

## Enrollment process in fleetd

When installing a fleetd package the `orbit` binary is executed.
`orbit` runs as `root` on macOS/Linux and as a `SYSTEM` service on Windows.

During installation, the enroll secret is placed as a text file only accessible to `root`/`SYSTEM`.
When `orbit` starts for the first time, it will attempt to enroll to Fleet using the enroll secret.
If the enroll secret is valid, then Fleet will generate a random "orbit node key" and return it to `orbit`.
`orbit` will store such "node key" on a text file only accessible to `root`/`SYSTEM`. After enrollment, the "orbit node key" will be used to authenticate orbit related requests to Fleet.

`orbit` will start the `osquery` daemon (that also runs as `root`/`SYSTEM`).
The `osquery` daemon will enroll to Fleet using the same enroll secret used by `orbit`.
Similarly, if the enroll secret is valid, then Fleet will generate a random "osquery node key" and return it to `osquery`.
`osquery` will store such "node key" on its internal RocksDB database file, only accessible to `root`/`SYSTEM`.
After enrollment, the "osquery node key" will be used to authenticate osquery related requests to Fleet.

On macOS and Windows, once the `orbit` and `osquery` enrollment process is completes, the enroll secret is removed from the file system and stored in the Apple keychain and Windows credentials manager respectively.

After starting osquery, `orbit` will also start the `Fleet desktop` tray application. Such application runs as the Desktop GUI user (it does not run as `root`/`SYSTEM`). Before starting `Fleet desktop`, `orbit` will set a random "Fleet desktop token" and send it to Fleetthe `orbit` authenticated communication channel. `orbit` stores such token on a file accessible to the GUI user and `Fleet desktop` will use such token to authenticate requests to Fleet.

When the user clicks on "My device" on the tray icon menu, Fleet Desktop will open the default browser on a URL that contains the "Fleet desktop token". For this very reason, the "Fleet desktop token" is rotated every hour (by `orbit`).

Here's a diagram to summarize fleetd communication channels after enrollment (more on "tuf.fleetctl.com" below):

graph LR;

tuf["tuf.fleetctl.com"];

subgraph fleetd;
    orbit;
    osquery;
    desktop[Fleet desktop];
end;

server[Fleet];

orbit -- HTTPS w/ orbit node key --> server;
osquery -- HTTPS w/ osquery node key --> server;
desktop -- HTTPS w/ Fleet desktop token --> server;

orbit -- HTTPS + The Update Framework --> tuf;
```

## Fleetd auto updates

`orbit` uses the [The Update Framework](https://theupdateframework.io/) to perform secure auto-updates.
By default, `orbit` has public root keys embedded in it to only trust updates published and signed in Fleet's TUF repository https://tuf.fleetctl.com (via HTTPS).

fleetd can also be customized to use a user-controlled "TUF" server.
More information can be found on orbit's Github [README](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/tree/main/orbit).

## TLS with custom CA certificates

By default, fleetd uses the OS root CA certificate store and also embeds the [Mozilla CA certificate store](https://curl.se/docs/caextract.html).
fleetd also supports setting custom root CA certificates that will be used to communicate to Fleet and the TUF server.
More information can be found on the [Certificates in fleetd]((https://fleetdm.com/guides/certificates-in-fleetd#basic-article) guide.

## mTLS

> The Fleet server does not provide support for mTLS.
> Users that want to use mTLS on their endpoints must setup a load balancer or TLS terminator like AWS's ELB or nginx that support mTLS.

The fleetd agent does provide basic support for mTLS. See the [Using mTLS](https://fleetdm.com/guides/enroll-hosts#using-mtls) guide.

## ADE and Autopilot MDM flow

When your macOS/Windows endpoints enroll to Fleet via MDM protocols, Fleet will send a command to automatically install fleetd on the enrolled endpoints. Fleet will also send a configuration profile to automatically configure the "enroll secret" and "Fleet URL" so that the enrollment process documented above can take place.
