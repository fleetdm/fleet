# Deploying Fleet on AWS with Terraform

![Deploying Fleet on AWS with Terraform](https://miro.medium.com/1*IzLHvDlUTDj3SXzLUQqPYA.png)

There are many ways to deploy Fleet. Last time, we looked at deploying [Fleet on Render](./articles/deploying-fleet-on-render.md). This time, we’re going to deploy Fleet on AWS with Terraform IaC (infrastructure as code).

Deploying on AWS with Fleet’s reference architecture will get you a fully functional Fleet instance that can scale to your needs

## Prerequisites:

- AWS CLI installed
- Terraform installed (version 1.04 or greater)
- AWS Account and IAM user capable of creating resources
- Clone [Fleet](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet) or copy the [terraform files](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/tree/fleet-v4.7.0/tools/terraform)

## Bootstrapping

To bootstrap our [remote state](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/state/remote.html) resources, we’ll create a S3 bucket and DynamoDB table. You can use the resources in [`remote-state`](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/state/remote.html) as an example. Override the `prefix` terraform variable to get unique resources.

1. `terraform init`
2. `terraform workspace new prod`
3. `terraform apply -var prefix=queryops`

You should be able to see all the resources that Terraform will create — the **S3 bucket** and the **dynamodb** table:

```
Plan: 3 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Do you want to perform these actions in workspace "dev"?

Terraform will perform the actions described above.

Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

Enter a value:
```

After typing `yes` you should have a new S3 bucket named `<prefix>-terraform-remote-state` And the table `<prefix>-terraform-state-lock`. Keep these handy because we’ll need them in the following steps.

## Infastructure
https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/tools/terraform

Using the buckets and table we just created, we’ll update the [remote state](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/tree/fleet-v4.7.0/tools/terraform/main.tf) to expect the same values:

```
terraform {
  // bootstrapped in ./remote-state
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "queryops-terraform-remote-state"
    region         = "us-east-2"
    key            = "fleet/"
    dynamodb_table = "queryops-terraform-state-lock"
  }
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "3.57.0"
    }
  }
}
```

We’ll also need a `tfvars` file to make some environment-specific variable overrides. Create a file in the same directory named `prod.tfvars` and paste the contents (note the bucket names will have to be unique for your environment):

```
fleet_backend_cpu         = 1024
fleet_backend_mem         = 4096 //software inventory requires 4GB
redis_instance            = "cache.t3.micro"
fleet_min_capacity        = 1
fleet_max_capacity        = 5
domain_fleetdm            = fleet.queryops.com // YOUR DOMAIN HERE
software_inventory        = "1"
vulnerabilities_path      = "/fleet/vuln"
osquery_results_s3_bucket = "queryops-osquery-results-archive-dev"
osquery_status_s3_bucket  = "queryops-osquery-status-archive-dev"
file_carve_bucket         = "queryops-file-carve"
```

Now we’re ready to apply the terraform:

1. `terraform init`
2. `terraform workspace new prod`
3. `terraform apply -var-file=prod.tfvars`

You should see the planned output, and you will need to confirm the creation. Review this output, and type `yes` when you are ready. This process should take 5–10 minutes.

Let’s say we own `queryops.com` and have an ACM certificate issued to it. We want to host Fleet at `fleet.queryops.com` so in this case, we’ll need to hand nameserver authority over to `fleet.queryops.com` before ACM will verify via DNS and issue the certificate. To make this work, we need to create an `NS` record on `queryops.com`, and put the same `NS` records that get created after terraform creates the `fleet.queryops.com` hosted zone.

Once `terraform apply` finishes you should see output similar to:

```
acm_certificate_arn = "arn:aws:acm:us-east-2:123169442427:certificate/b2845034-d4e1-4ff2-9630-1c93feaf2185"
aws_alb_name = "fleetdm"
aws_alb_target_group_name = "fleetdm"
backend_security_group = "arn:aws:ec2:us-east-2:123169442427:security-group/sg-00c9fa9632d7e03ca"
fleet-backend-task-revision = 5
fleet-migration-task-revision = 4
fleet_ecs_cluster_arn = "arn:aws:ecs:us-east-2:123169442427:cluster/fleet-backend"
fleet_ecs_cluster_id = "arn:aws:ecs:us-east-2:123169442427:cluster/fleet-backend"
fleet_ecs_service_name = "fleet"
fleet_min_capacity = 2
load_balancer_arn_suffix = "app/fleetdm/3427efb8c09088be"
mysql_cluster_members = toset([
  "fleetdm-mysql-iam-1",
])
nameservers_fleetdm = tolist([
  "ns-1181.awsdns-19.org",
  "ns-1823.awsdns-35.co.uk",
  "ns-314.awsdns-39.com",
  "ns-881.awsdns-46.net",
])
private_subnets = [
  "arn:aws:ec2:us-east-2:123169442427:subnet/subnet-03a54736c942cd1e4",
  "arn:aws:ec2:us-east-2:123169442427:subnet/subnet-07b59b34d4e0850e5",
  "arn:aws:ec2:us-east-2:123169442427:subnet/subnet-084d808e122d776af",
]
redis_cluster_members = toset([
  "fleetdm-redis-001",
  "fleetdm-redis-002",
  "fleetdm-redis-003",
])
target_group_arn_suffix = "targetgroup/fleetdm/0f3bec83c8b02f58"
```

We can use the output here to create an AWS ECS Task that will migrate the database and prepare it for use.

```
aws ecs run-task --cluster fleet-backend --task-definition fleet-migrate:<latest_version> --launch-type FARGATE --network-configuration "awsvpcConfiguration={subnets=[<private_subnet_id>],securityGroups=[<desired_security_group>]}"
```

Where `<private_subnet_id>` is one of the private subnets, and `<desired_security_group>` is the security group from the output for example:

```
aws ecs run-task --cluster fleet-backend --task-definition fleet-migrate:4 --launch-type FARGATE --network-configuration "awsvpcConfiguration={subnets=[subnet-03a54736c942cd1e4],securityGroups=[sg-00c9fa9632d7e03ca]}"
```

Running this command should kick off the migration task, and Fleet should be ready to go.

Navigating to `https://fleet.queryops.com` we should be greeted with the Setup page.

## Conclusion

Setting up all the required infrastructure to run a dedicated web service in AWS can be a daunting task. The Fleet team’s goal is to provide a solid base to build from. As most AWS environments have their own specific needs and requirements, this base is intended to be modified and tailored to your specific needs.
