# Cannabis technology company

## Bringing "management as code" to cannabis technology

A leading technology provider for the cannabis industry with a fleet heavily weighted toward macOS sought a platform that offered deep integration and advanced Windows management.

## At a glance

- **Endpoints:** ~418+ (primarily macOS with ongoing Windows migration).  
- **Primary requirement:** GitOps approach and Okta integration.  
- **Key integrations:** Okta. Tableau, and Datadog (planned).  
- **Previous solution:** Jamf and Intune.  

## The challenge: tool consolidation

While they had coverage with Jamf, they faced significant pain points on the Windows management side and wanted better coverage consistency.

## The solution: personal verification

Fleet’s open-source nature allows them to personally verify the security and logic of their stack. They prioritized the platform’s team structure support and its seamless connection with Okta for conditional access.

## The results: independent problem solving

- **Smooth migration:** macOS migration was completed smoothly with minimal disruption.  
- **Instant verification:** live queries allowed the team to verify compliance instantly rather than relying on stale data.  
- **Empowered staff:** Fleet’s training resources and Slack community have empowered staff to solve problems more independently and onboard faster.
