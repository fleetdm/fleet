- **Primary Requirement:** GitOps approach and Okta integration.  
- **Key Integrations:** Okta. Tableau, and Datadog (planned).  
- **Previous Solution:** Jamf and Intune.  

## The Challenge: Tool Consolidation

While they had coverage with Jamf, they faced significant pain points on the Windows management side and wanted better coverage consistency.
