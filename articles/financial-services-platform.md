# Financial services platform manages 6,000+ hosts with continuous compliance visibility

A financial services platform manages a complex environment of 2,000 to 6,000 hosts and hundreds of mobile devices. They required a platform that offered flexibility without proprietary limitations.

## At a glance

- **Endpoints:** 6,000+ hosts & 400+ mobile devices.  
- **Primary requirement:** Cross-platform support (Mac, Windows, iOS, Android) and RBAC.  
- **Key integrations:** Jira, Zendesk, and SIEM/SOAR systems.  
- **Previous solution:** Workspace ONE.  

## The challenge

They struggled with the complexity and poor support of Workspace ONE, specifically lacking self-service portals for iOS and having inefficient app allow/block lists. Linux servers were a notable blind spot.

## The solution

The ability to review source code and use open practices was described as the "cornerstone" of their confidence in their management stack. They prioritized full osquery integration for granular, SQL-based data.

## The results

- **Automated software deployment:** they replaced manual MSI installations with software deployment automation via the API.  
- **Seamless migration:** by running Fleet in parallel with legacy systems, they ensured a seamless "behind-the-scenes" transition for employees.  
- **Custom SIEM dashboards:** the security team builds custom dashboards by integrating device telemetry directly with their SIEM/SOAR systems for rapid incident response.
