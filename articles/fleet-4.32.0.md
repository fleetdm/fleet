## Highlights

* End user migration
* macOS Setup Assistant custom setup panes per team


### End user migration

_Available in Fleet Premium and Fleet Ultimate_

Achieve ðŸŸ¢ Results when migrating users to Fleet from your previous MDM solution. Fleet's end user migration workflow allows you to take ðŸŸ  Ownership of your user migration, making moving your fleet to Fleet quick and easy. 

With Fleet installed, users will be prompted to migrate their device to Fleet for management. To build confidence with your users, Fleet allows for full customization of your organization name, logo, and contact link displayed in the prompt. Once initiated, a webhook is triggered, which can be used to kick off a workflow to unenroll the device from the previous MDM solution using Tines, Okta Workflows, Make, and other no-code automation platforms.

### macOS Setup Assistant custom setup panes per team

_Available in Fleet Premium and Fleet Ultimate_

Continuing Fleetâ€™s ðŸŸ£ Openness and GitOps forward approach to MDM, we are excited to allow full control of the macOS Setup Assistant using an automatic enrollment profile. An automatic enrollment profile allows administrators to select which screens users see in the macOS Setup Assistant using a JSON file. 

With this addition, administrators can have different setup experiences for each teamâ€”allowing a conference room computer to skip all setup screens while users see the screens they need. Controlling the macOS Setup Assistant using a JSON file allows for version control, review, and approval using a GitOps workflow. Additionally, when Apple releases new features (keys), administrators do not need to wait for a Fleet release to support these new features.
