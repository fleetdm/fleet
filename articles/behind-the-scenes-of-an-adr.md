# Behind the Scenes of an Account Development Representative (ADR)

Hey there! If you’ve landed on this page, you might be curious about the ADR role’s purpose. You likely know the basics of what they do—research leads, orchestrate outreach, events, etc.—but there’s a whole lot more to it. In this post, I’ll take you through both the big picture of why ADRs are so crucial and how Fleet’s ADR training thinks about marketing and sales.

## Why ADRs matter: the big picture
ADRs are the link between marketing and sales teams, particularly in SaaS companies. Their work has a direct impact on how quickly and smoothly deals progress, and, most importantly, on building authentic relationships with potential customers.


### Fueling the sales engine
Imagine the sales process as a funnel. ADRs are at the very top, discovering potential customers and guiding them through the early stages—from “Who are you?” to “Wow, I need this!” They’re the engine that keeps your pipeline full and your sales cycle moving.

### Quality over quantity: the ADR superpower
When a lead finally reaches the sales team, it’s not just any lead—it’s a purposeful point of contact that’s already become familiar to the brand. Instead of high-volume, generic outreach, ADRs focus on purposeful engagement that actually resonates.

### The Human Touch in a Digital World
Outreach has increasingly become dominated by automation and chatbots, ADRs brings a personal touch and coordinate collaboration internally. 

## Fleet’s ADR training program
It’s about research, personalization, and nurturing genuine relationships. Fleet has a system for understanding where each prospect sits on the awareness and interest scale, from “Unaware” to “Has Team Buy-In.” By the time these leads reach me as an AE, they often have a use case already and want to solve specific problems.


### Inbound vs. outbound: two sides of the same coin
Fleet’s ADRs handle both inbound leads (those who’ve already shown some interest) and outbound leads (those we think would benefit from Fleet but aren’t aware yet). Each approach requires different tactics, but both aim to build authentic relationships grounded in genuine value.

### How Fleet’s ADRs drive impact
Fleet’s ADRs operate with five core focus areas and a clear life cycle to ensure every lead is handled with care and expertise:

- **Validating account data:** Before any outreach, we verify the essentials so we’re always speaking to the right people at the right organizations. 

- **Collaborating with engineers:** ADRs coordinate outreach with engineers to ensure that prospects have direct access to those who speak their language.

- **Qualifying use cases:** ADRs determine if the contact simply knows about Fleet or if they already see how Fleet can solve a key issue (e.g., device management, software orchestration, or vulnerability management).

### Hand-off to AEs:
When a lead is truly “sales-ready,” the Solutions Consultant and the ADR share all the gathered insights with the Account Executive. Instead of guesswork, it’s a smooth hand-off with clear context, so the AE can jump into partnership discussions fully informed.

### In conclusion: ADRs as the secret sauce

ADRs are far more than a stepping stone to another sales role; they’re at the heart of business growth and brand-building. By focusing on the right people, infusing outreach with a human touch, and carefully nurturing leads from intrigued to sales-ready, ADRs are the backbone of a modern, effective sales strategy.

If you’re intrigued by this approach, I’d encourage you to check out [Fleet’s Handbook](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/why-this-way#why-open-source) to see our commitment to transparency, being open-source, and why we sell the way we do. After all, great marketing and sales aren’t about quick hits—they’re about creating long-term value for everyone involved.
Thanks for reading, and here’s to the ADRs out there, making the sales engine hum!
