## Highlights

* Fleet adds support for ChromeOS
* Boosted compliance with 'verified' status


### Additional tables for ChromeOS

In line with Fleet's value of ðŸŸ¢ Results, we work relentlessly to enhance your experience. Our aim is to deliver results, focusing on pragmatic and meaningful improvements. With this in mind, we are delighted to introduce new ChromeOS-specific tables: screenlock, system_state, privacy_preferences, and disk_info. These additions not only represent our commitment to iterative progress but also our dedication to enhancing Fleet's utility for managing and understanding your ChromeOS devices better.


### Load testing CIS Benchmarks for macOS

Embodying Fleet's values of ðŸŸ  Ownership and ðŸŸ¢ Results, our team is always ready to tackle challenges head-on for the sake of delivering a reliable and high-performing product. Recently, we pondered the performance impact of running the comprehensive set of 100 CIS Benchmarks for macOS, known colloquially as "eating our own dogfood."

Upon digging deeper, our engineers identified CIS queries 5.1.5, 5.1.6, and 5.1.7 as the three primary outliers in terms of CPU usage and memory footprint. These queries were found to be causing process terminations due to high resource usage.

The queries, which are designed to verify appropriate permissions for system-wide applications (5.1.5) and ensure no world-writable files exist in the System Folder (5.1.6) or Library Folder (5.1.7), had to be refined for efficiency.

With a clear focus on achieving results and owning the challenges we face, this rigorous load testing has led not only to the improvement of the 5.1.5, 5.1.6, and 5.1.7 queries but also to the development of additional tooling for future load testing. This is another stride in our continued effort to enhance Fleet and osquery's performance, reliability, and user experience.
