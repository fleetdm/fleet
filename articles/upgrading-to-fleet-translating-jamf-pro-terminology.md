| Extension Attribute            | Query or Policy        | Depending on your use case, a Query is similar to an Extension Attribute used to gather specific information from a device. Similarly, a Policy is used to return a boolean (Yes/No or True/False) response about a device.                                                                |
| Sites                          | Teams                  | Teams expand on the concept of Sites. Where a Site is typically based on location or division of administrative oversight, a Team can be based on this or other attributes that fit your needs like device baselines, test devices, hardware types, etc. https\://fleetdm.com/guides/teams |
