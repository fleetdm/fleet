# Enterprise AI security company

## Verifiable control for AI security research

An emerging leader in enterprise AI security. As a company of security scientists, they required deep, queryable visibility to match their Zero Trust philosophy.

## At a glance

- **Endpoints:** ~35 (macOS and Linux).  
- **Primary Requirement:** Security-as-Code and OS interoperability.  
- **Key Integrations:** CI/CD pipelines.  
- **Previous Solution:** Legacy MDMs.  

## The Challenge: "Black Box" Visibility

They found legacy MDMs to be restrictive "black boxes" that lacked necessary Linux visibility.

## The Solution: Raw Truth

Fleet’s use of osquery turned Linux workstations from a blind spot into a source of real-time security telemetry. The open-source core allows them to audit their own management infrastructure, which is a key requirement for their security-first mission.

## The Results: Instant CVE Response

- **Zero-Impact Transition:** Engineers appreciated the move to a lightweight agent that doesn't hinder productivity.  
- **IDE Security:** They use Fleet to monitor for risky IDE extensions (like VS Code or Cursor) to ensure AI coding tools remain secure.  
- **SOC 2 Maintenance:** When a new CVE is announced, they run a live query to get an answer in seconds, which is vital for maintaining SOC 2 status.
