# Leading interactive entertainment company adopts Fleet for MDM

<div purpose="attribution-quote">

We wanted an open-source MDM to easily use configuration-as-code, deliver the best possible experience for our employees, and make security happy.

## Challenge

They were facing challenges in managing their devices across multiple platforms. Their previous solution lacked integration with their configuration management tool, Puppet, and did not align with their preferred Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) workflows. Additionally, performance issues with their interim solution necessitated finding an alternative before undergoing another full migration. They required a scalable, cross-platform MDM solution with a clear migration path, enhanced visibility, and automation capabilities.

## Solution

Fleet’s open-source platform enables a declarative approach alongside robust API and webhook support. Through seamless [automations](https://fleetdm.com/guides/automations#host-status-automations), integration with existing systems, and support for multiple operating systems, they eliminated the need for inefficient manual workflows and extensive customizations.

## Results

<div purpose="checklist">

Visibility into every endpoint dynamic host segmentation

Introduced new infrastructure as code workflows.

Unified device management across macOS and Windows.

Smooth and seamless migration.
</div>

By switching to Fleet, they continue to manage their devices through automated MDM workflows that support thousands of devices. Capabilities like automated device enrollment, dynamic host segmentation, real-time querying, and assisted migration allowed them to enforce security settings without overly restricting endpoints or their users.


## Their Story

The global leader in interactive entertainment and software development manages an extensive fleet of devices supporting game development, publishing, and operations. To overcome the challenges of scalability and customization, they partnered with Fleet early on to help contribute to Fleet’s MDM roadmap, resulting in a solution tailored for cross-platform enterprise teams.

A few key factors drove the decision to switch to Fleet. They needed compatibility across macOS and Windows, integrations with existing tools like [Puppet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puppet_(software)), and effortless scaling to thousands of devices.

With Fleet, they achieved this through:

- Next-gen change management
- Real-time insights through definitive data
- Eliminating tool overlap
- Dedicated support and a seamless migration

### Next-gen change management

Fleet is open-source, allowing engineering teams to audit, customize, and extend the platform as needed alongside [infrastructure-as-code workflows](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet-gitops). This makes device management more agile and automated while reducing errors through peer review.

### Real-time querying and definitive data

Fleet’s query engine, [osquery](https://osquery.io/), allowed the company to run live [queries](https://fleetdm.com/guides/queries), dynamically segment hosts, and gain real-time insights across their entire fleet. This capability enhanced incident response and ensured critical policies and configurations were consistently enforced through Fleet’s double-check [verification](https://fleetdm.com/guides/custom-os-settings#os-settings-status).

### Eliminate tool overlap

They were able to replace multiple tools and consolidate the management of thousands of macOS and Windows devices into a single platform. Fleet’s open [API](https://fleetdm.com/docs/rest-api/rest-api) and CLI tools also allowed them to build custom integrations with their existing systems and support flexible [logging pipelines](https://fleetdm.com/guides/log-destinations), like AWS and GCP.

### Best-in-class support

Fleet provides timely issue resolutions, guidance, and ensures a smooth transition with minimal disruption. [Migrations](https://fleetdm.com/guides/mdm-migration#basic-article) are directly assisted by Fleet’s best-in-class [support](https://fleetdm.com/support) teams and built-in [migration tools](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/tree/main/tools/mdm/migration).


## Conclusion

By switching to Fleet, it solved their critical challenges in device management, including integration with existing tools, cross-platform compatibility, and scalability. Fleet's Infrastructure-as-Code workflows, real-time querying, and automation eliminated manual inefficiencies and consolidated tools. With Fleet, the company improved visibility, enforced security policies, and managed thousands of devices with minimal performance impacts. The smooth migration process and dedicated support made Fleet a practical, long-term solution for their complex, enterprise-level needs.
