# Healthcare technology organization

## Rapid policy enforcement and end-user transparency

A healthcare technology organization operates in a highly regulated environment requiring SOC 2, HIPAA, and HITRUST compliance. They needed a centralized management solution for a globally distributed fleet that could enforce policies faster than the industry standard.

## At a glance

- **Endpoints:** ~300 hosts initially, scaling to 500 (Mac, Windows, Linux).  
- **Primary Requirement:** Rapid policy enforcement and multi-OS support.  
- **Key Integrations:** Centralized multi-OS management, policy enforcement capabilities, and support for self-hosting.Self-hosting for HITRUST compliance.  
- **Previous Solution:** Intune.  

## The Challenge: Slow deployments and unreliable tools

Under Intune, the team faced policy deployment times that could take up to a month. This was ineffective for a team managing multiple OS platforms across a global workforce. They also lacked the visibility needed to ensure remote devices remained compliant with strict security frameworks.

## The Solution: Centralized control and visibility

The team chose Fleet to achieve centralized management and rapid policy enforcement. By running a self-hosted instance, they maintained the data control necessary to meet HITRUST requirements. Fleet’s transparency feature was also critical, as it informed end-users exactly why a device was non-compliant and how to fix it.

## The Results: Drastic efficiency gains

- **Migration Speed:** Migration time was reduced from 2 hours per device to just 10 minutes.  
- **Automated Remediation:** Automated software installs and self-service scripts replaced manual interventions, saving significant man-hours.  
- **Agile Response:** Frequent host check-ins allowed for more agile threat responses and faster detection of vulnerabilities.
