# AI security company runs live queries to verify CVEs in seconds

An emerging leader in enterprise AI security required deep, queryable visibility to match its Zero Trust philosophy.

## At a glance

- **Endpoints:** ~35 (macOS and Linux).  
- **Primary requirement:** security-as-code and OS interoperability.  
- **Key integrations:** CI/CD pipelines.  
- **Previous solution:** legacy MDMs.  

## The challenge

They found legacy MDMs to be restrictive "black boxes" that lacked necessary Linux visibility.

## The solution

Fleet’s use of osquery turned Linux workstations from a blind spot into a source of real-time security telemetry. The open-source core allows them to audit their own management infrastructure, which is a key requirement for their security-first mission.

## The results

- **Zero-impact transition:** engineers appreciated the move to a lightweight agent that doesn't hinder productivity.  
- **IDE security:** they use Fleet to monitor for risky IDE extensions (like VS Code or Cursor) to ensure AI coding tools remain secure.  
- **SOC 2 maintenance:** when a new CVE is announced, they run a live query to get an answer in seconds, which is vital for maintaining SOC 2 status.
