## Jira integrations
**Available to all Fleet users.**

You can now configure Fleet to automatically create a Jira ticket when a new vulnerability (CVE) is detected on your hosts. No need to create tickets or spend time configuring a webhook manually. 

## Improved live query experience
**Available to all Fleet users.**

![Improved live query experience](http://fleetdm.com/images/articles/show-query-1600x900@2x.png)

We added a “Show query” option to the live query results view. You can now double-check the syntax you used and compare that to your results without leaving the current view.

## Postman Collection
**Available to all Fleet users.**
