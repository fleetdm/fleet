Managing devices and vulnerabilities shouldn't mean installing two different agents, or paying for two different platforms. Fleet brings MDM and vulnerability management into one console, using one lightweight agent. So your security team and IT team can work together on the same source of truth. 

## Why this way?

- No separate agent for MDM, vulnerability management, and telemetry. 
- No silos between device visibility and vulnerability response.
- No extra overhead for teams that manage Macs, Windows, and Linux.

## The problem: Double the agents, double the headaches

Talk to most IT teams today and you'll find a familiar pattern. One team manages devices with an MDM solution. Another team scans for vulnerabilities with a separate security tool. Each system requires its own agent installation, maintenance cycle, system resources, and SMEs.

The two datasets rarely align perfectly, and can lead to gaps in coverage and duplicated effort. This predictably creates friction — especially when security teams scramble to identify affected devices after a critical vulnerability surfaces, or IT teams work separately to push patches.

For orgs running mixed environments (macOS, Windows, Linux), the complexity multiplies.  
Different platforms often require different tools, creating a patchwork of solutions that's expensive to maintain and hard to coordinate.

## Clear the thicket

Fleet eliminates this duplication by design. The `fleetd` agent is your device manager, vulnerability scanner, software deployer, and inventory system - all in one. This unified approach transforms how IT and security teams collaborate, meaning:

- No more “reach across the aisle” syncs.
- Both teams operate from the same real-time dataset.
- When a new vulnerability emerges, security sees which devices are affected and IT deploys the fix, all in one flow.
- Patch deployment integrates into the same system already managing your devices.

Teams spend less time gathering and correlating, and more time securing and managing devices. And that's the goal, right?

## Built for modern IT teams

Fleet understands that modern IT teams need flexibility, not lock-in. So whether you're running GitOps workflows, managing air-gapped environments, or supporting remote teams across time zones, Fleet gives you the openness to adapt to how your team actually works. And because Fleet is built on open source foundations, you maintain complete visibility into what data is collected, how it's processed, and how it flows into your security and IT tools.

You can write custom queries, fine-tune data collection, and export results into the systems your teams already rely on. This is especially valuable for compliance-focused organizations. Allowing them to easily audit what Fleet collects, modify queries to meet regulatory requirements, and align vuln management with internal security policies. No black-box behavior required.

## Beyond Apple: True cross-platform management

Your org likely runs a mix of macOS, Windows, and Linux. Each of these platforms often gets its own management tool, which leads to administrative overhead, security blind spots, and fragmented reporting. 

With Fleet, those silos disappear. You have one policy engine, one query language, and one vulnerability view.

IT teams work from a single clean interface, security monitors one dashboard, and executives see unified reporting.

This also benefits orgs with hybrid cloud or BYOD strategies—support the tools your people actually use, without sacrificing security or control.

## Implementation is simpler than you think 

Deploying Fleet doesn't require a rip-and-replace. It installs **alongside your existing tools**, so you can start with data collection and basic vuln management, add MDM and software deployment when your team is ready. You can move at your own pace while gaining immediate visibility benefits.
