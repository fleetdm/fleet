# Bridging the gap: How Fleet empowers Linux device management in a multi-platform world

Over the past 20 years, I’ve been in roles that ultimately supported or managed Apple devices. I consider myself fortunate to have avoided managing Windows devices in an enterprise environment, aside from the occasional virtual machine or user needing Boot Camp (remember that?!). Throughout my career, I’ve also spent considerable time managing various Linux servers and can confirm that the tools available for Linux administration are as diverse in functionality and usability as the many Linux distributions themselves. 

## Why you need Linux device management

As more companies embrace user choice, Linux has become an increasingly popular option among passionate users. With most communications and business tools now being cloud-based or delivered through SaaS solutions, employees have more freedom to choose their preferred operating system. This trend is particularly evident among developers, engineers, and science-focused roles, where Linux's flexibility, performance, and [open-source nature](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/why-this-way#why-open-source) are highly valued. These users are often the most enthusiastic about technology, driven by a belief in open source and a desire for full control over everything running on their devices.

Despite this growing adoption, traditional Mobile Device Management (MDM) solutions have often lacked sufficient support for Linux devices. Unlike macOS or Windows, MDM for Linux isn't as straightforward, but achieving the same management outcomes is still possible. A solid Linux device management solution should allow IT administrators to execute scripts remotely, install or patch software, and collect up-to-date device state information. Each of these capabilities is crucial for maintaining consistency, security, and compliance across an organization's diverse infrastructure.

The need for Linux device management goes beyond just ensuring devices are compliant. It's about empowering teams to use the tools they are most comfortable with while maintaining the security and efficiency that IT departments require. By implementing a reliable Linux management solution, companies can support user choice without compromising on the management and control necessary for a secure IT environment.

## The challenges of Linux device management

Managing Linux devices comes with its own set of unique challenges. One of the biggest hurdles is the inherent diversity of Linux distributions. Unlike the standardized environments of Windows or macOS, Linux offers a wide range of distributions, each with different package managers, system configurations, and desktop environments. This diversity makes it difficult for IT teams to apply consistent management practices across all Linux devices. What works for one distribution may not work for another, requiring additional time and expertise to handle these variations effectively.

This flexibility is part of what makes Linux so appealing, but it also means that traditional MDM solutions often fall short. Most MDM tools are designed for homogeneous or even platform-specific environments, which makes them poorly suited to handle the diverse and varied nature of Linux. In recent years, however, specialized tools and platforms have emerged to address these gaps. Leveraging techniques derived from Linux server management, these tools offer IT administrators the ability to manage Linux workstations with the same oversight and control as other operating systems.

Another significant challenge is the lack of experienced Linux client platform engineers. While the number of professionals skilled in Linux is growing, it is still far from the level of expertise available for macOS or Windows. This scarcity means that Linux management solutions need to be as intuitive and easy to use as possible, allowing IT teams to implement and scale their management practices without requiring extensive Linux knowledge. Just as the market for macOS platform engineers grew over the past decade, we can expect a similar trend for Linux.

Lastly, the open-source nature of Linux can also present challenges when it comes to security and compliance. Unlike proprietary operating systems, Linux is highly customizable, which can lead to inconsistencies and vulnerabilities if not properly managed. A robust Linux management strategy should therefore include automated patching, monitoring, and configuration management to ensure that all devices are secure and compliant, regardless of their distribution or customization level.

## Key features to Look for in a Linux MDM solution

When evaluating a Linux MDM solution, it's crucial to focus on features that address the unique challenges of managing Linux devices effectively:

1. **Remote Scripting and Automation:** The ability to [execute scripts](https://fleetdm.com/guides/scripts) remotely is fundamental for managing Linux devices at scale. This feature allows IT teams to automate a wide range of tasks, such as installing software, performing system updates, and adjusting configurations, all without needing manual intervention on each device. Automation not only saves time but also helps ensure consistency.
2. **Comprehensive Software Management:** [Managing software](https://fleetdm.com/software-management) across different Linux distributions can be complex due to the diversity of package management systems. A strong Linux MDM solution should simplify this process, providing tools to [manage software installations](https://fleetdm.com/guides/deploy-software-packages), updates, and removals seamlessly, regardless of whether devices are using Debian-based or RPM-based distributions.
3. **Device State Monitoring and Reporting:** Having visibility into the status of each device is crucial for proactive management. A Linux MDM solution should provide real-time monitoring and detailed reporting on hardware and software configurations, compliance status, and potential issues. This level of insight allows IT administrators to quickly identify and address problems before they escalate, ensuring all devices remain secure and compliant.
4. **Security and Compliance Management:** Given the highly customizable nature of Linux, maintaining security and compliance can be a challenge. An effective Linux MDM should include automated patch management, vulnerability assessments, and compliance checks. These features help ensure that all devices adhere to organizational security policies and are protected against the latest threats, regardless of their configuration or distribution.
5. **Multi-Platform Compatibility:** Most organizations operate in a [multi-platform environment](https://fleetdm.com/device-management), with devices running a mix of Linux, Windows, and macOS. A good Linux MDM solution should integrate seamlessly with existing device management tools, offering a unified interface for managing all platforms. This integration streamlines the management process, reduces the learning curve for IT teams, and ensures consistent policy enforcement across the entire device ecosystem.
6. **User-Friendly Interfaces:** Given the scarcity of Linux client platform engineers, ease of use is more crucial than ever. A Linux MDM solution must provide an intuitive interface that allows IT administrators—regardless of their Linux expertise—to efficiently manage and support Linux devices. Additionally, end users should have a straightforward, easy-to-use interface to access IT services seamlessly, minimizing complexity and ensuring a positive user experience.
