# Enroll BYOD iOS/iPadOS hosts

This guide will walk you through the process of inviting BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) iPhones and iPads to enroll in Fleet.

By enrolling BYOD iPhones and iPads in Fleet, IT admins can manage software installations, enforce settings, and ensure devices comply with company policies. By adding BYOD devices, you can monitor, enforce settings, and manage security on BYOD iPhones and iPads in real-time, providing enhanced control without compromising user autonomy. This helps secure access to organizational resources while maintaining control over device configurations.

## Prerequisites

* Fleet [v4.57.0](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/releases/tag/fleet-v4.57.0).
* [MDM enabled and configured](https://fleetdm.com/guides/macos-mdm-setup)

## Enrolling BYOD iPad/iOS devices in Fleet

* **Step 1: Navigate to the manage hosts page**
    * Click “Hosts” in the top navigation bar
* **Step 2: Choose the team**
    * Select the desired [team](https://fleetdm.com/guides/teams) from the menu at the top of the screen
* **Step 3: Get a link to share with your end users**
    * Click on “Add hosts.”
    * In the modal, select the **iOS & iPadOS** tab.
    * Copy the link to enroll hosts.
* **Step 4: Distribute the link**
    * Share the link with your end users using an introductory email or message.
    * The link provides instructions to guide users through downloading and installing Fleet’s enrollment profile.

> Each team has a unique URL that includes the team's enrollment secret. This enrollment secret ensures that devices are assigned to the correct team during enrollment. When an incorrect enroll secret is provided, users can still download the enrollment profile, but the enrollment itself will fail (403 error).
