Fleet 4.64.0 is live. Check out the full [changelog](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/releases/tag/fleet-v4.64.0) or continue reading to get the highlights.
For upgrade instructions, see our [upgrade guide](https://fleetdm.com/docs/deploying/upgrading-fleet) in the Fleet docs.

## Highlights

- Custom targets for software
- Bash scripts
- Fleetctl for Windows and Linux ARM

### Custom targets for software

IT admins can now install App Store apps only on macOS hosts that match specific labels. This allows for precise app deployment based host attributes like operating system (OS) version, hardware type, and more, ensuring the right apps reach the right devices.

### Bash scripts

Fleet now supports running Bash scripts (`#!/bin/bash`) on macOS and Linux. IT teams can execute scripts with ["bashisms"](https://mywiki.wooledge.org/Bashism) instead of rewriting these scripts to run in Z shell (Zsh).

Also, IT admins can now edit scripts within the Fleet UI. This eliminates the need to download, modify, and re-upload scripts, making it faster to fix typos or make small adjustments on the fly.

### Fleetctl for Windows and Linux ARM

Fleet users with Window or Linux ARM workstations can now use the fleetctl command-line interface (CLI) to run scripts, queries, and more. This expands Fleetâ€™s CLI capabilities, allowing users to manage hosts on their preferred operating system (OS). Learn more about fleetctl [here](https://fleetdm.com/guides/fleetctl).

## Changes

### Device management (MDM)
- Included current host status and pending action in lock, unlock, and wipe API calls.

### Bug fixes and improvements

- Added link to information about installing fleetd when packages are generated.
- Optimized software ingestion queries to use existing DB indexes in the software titles table.
- Normalized padding spacing for list headers, lists, and help text across various modals.
- Removed the resend button for failed windows disk encryption profiles and add messaging that tells the user that Fleet with automatically retry this profile again.

- Updated language in query comppatibility tooltip to clarify that compatibility is based only on tables.
