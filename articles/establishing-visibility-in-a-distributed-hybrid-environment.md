# Establishing visibility in a distributed hybrid environment

This global leader develops AI-powered smart boards and software designed to foster hybrid collaboration. As a high-growth tech company, they needed to move from a manual, unmanaged environment to a professional security posture—securing the distributed developer workstations and remote laptops used to build their collaboration suite—without slowing down their engineering teams.

## At a glance

- **Endpoints:** ~140 (macOS, Windows, and Linux).  
- **Primary Requirement:** Cross-platform management and a hosted Cloud solution.  
- **Key Integrations:** Fleet Cloud, ElasticSearch, and Stackdriver.  
- **Previous Solution:** No formal MDM (Manual management).  

## The Challenge: Total blind spots

Before adopting Fleet, they lacked a formal MDM solution. This created significant "blind spots," particularly across remote laptops and Linux workstations. The IT team had no reliable way to verify if devices were encrypted, track vulnerabilities, or ensure a consistent security posture across their distributed team and technical freelancers.

## The Solution: Transparent, cross-platform control

They chose Fleet to gain unified control over macOS, Windows, and Linux through a single platform. The decision was driven by Fleet's open-source foundation—which provided the transparency necessary to build trust with their technical staff—and the availability of Fleet Cloud to eliminate the overhead of server maintenance.

## The Results: Instant visibility and automated sync

- **Near-Instant Response:** With agent check-ins every 10–15 seconds, they can perform rapid vulnerability checks and maintain a continuous audit trail.  
- **API-Driven Automation:** They leverage Fleet’s API to sync user attributes and device data with internal directories, eliminating manual data entry.  
- **Developer Trust:** By showing exactly what is being monitored, the IT team has bridged the privacy gap with freelancers and internal developers, moving away from "black box" management.
