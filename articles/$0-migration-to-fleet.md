# $0 Migration to Fleet

Riding the wave of momentum generated by Apple with the release of macOS Tahoe 26.0 and its new feature for device management service migration, Fleet is releasing a **free** new service to help you migrate your device management configurations from Jamf to Fleet. With Fleet’s $0 migration service, our delivery team does the heavy lifting for you: exporting profiles, translating smart groups, replacing extension attributes, mapping policies, and redeploying apps. No guesswork, no year-long migration plans, and a zero-touch experience for your IT team.

## How It works

### Seamless device migration

Fleet follows Apple’s supported migration flow for Automated Device Enrollment (ADE). Devices re-enroll automatically, preserving user data and managed apps when possible. Migration deadlines, user notifications, and “await configuration” states are all handled in accordance with Apple's best practices. (*Note: seamless migrations with no end-user interaction are only available from Jamf on-prem instances today)

### Profile & policy replication

- Export .mobileconfig profiles from Jamf and re-apply them in Fleet.
- Translate smart groups into Fleet labels. 
- Replace extension attributes with Fleet queries, labels, or policies.
- Map Jamf policies to Fleet policies with automated remediation scripts or package installs.

### Software deployment, simplified

- Sync your Apple VPP apps directly into Fleet.
- Upload and scope custom macOS packages with labels.
- Preserve license continuity and ensure VPP token migration within Apple’s 30-day window.
- 

### Security & compliance first

- FileVault recovery keys are automatically escrowed to Fleet at migration.
- New Activation Lock and security controls are applied automatically during enrollment. 
- Continuous inventory and compliance monitoring.

## Why customers choose Fleet migration

- $0 Cost – Fleet covers migration as part of onboarding.
- Reduced IT Burden – Fleet’s experts handle prep, mapping, and testing.
- GitOps by default – Everything version-controlled and repeatable.
- Risk-Free – Canary testing ensures safety and planning windows before fleet-wide rollout
- Future-Proof – Continuous updates from Apple’s ecosystem and Fleet’s open-source foundation.
