Venturing into the digital wilderness of today's mobile device management feels akin to navigating an impenetrable thicket, each thorn a separate MDM platform demanding its own dedicated team, unique skill set, and custom strategies. This tangled maze saps your resources and weaves a web of vulnerabilities hidden within the dense underbrush of disjointed systems and overlapping responsibilities. As you push deeper, the realization dawns that this complexity doesn't fortify your defenses. Rather, it introduces gaps—cracks through which threats slip unnoticed, putting the integrity of your agency's devices at risk.


## Navigating the thicket: trials of multiple MDMs

Imagine navigating a thorny thicket of MDM tools, each with its own interface, cost, and limitations. That's the reality for many organizations, leading to:



* **Multiplied costs:** Software fees, support contracts, storage needs, and duplicated analytics bloat your budget exponentially.
* **Efficiency drain:** Your IT team gets bogged down with different people needed to manage multiple systems instead of focusing on real security and productivity.
* **Security blind spots:** Data gaps and inconsistent policies leave your organization vulnerable to evolving threats.
