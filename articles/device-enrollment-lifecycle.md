# Device enrollment lifecycle

If you manage devices, you've likely participated in one or more of these five stages of the device enrollment lifecycle — regardless of the quirks in your particular industry or service, your approach, or the tools you use.

1. **Assigning devices** (new or repurposed) to employees  
2. **Setting up management and security controls**  
   *E.g., scripts, profiles, settings*  
3. **Installing and managing software**  
4. **Determining a long-term management strategy**  
   *E.g., device state remediation and long-term security posture maintenance*  
5. **Collecting devices** after employee role changes or separations

## The problem

- **59%** of IT teams use 7 or more device management tools  
- **40%** of work time is spent on manual, repetitive tasks  
- **64%** of executives prioritize data security  
- **67%** of executives and IT teams find security challenging  

Traditional device management is becoming a risk. The sheer number of tools used is a factor.  

Each individual tool, when acquired, may seem perfect (like that melon baller in your kitchen drawer you rarely use…)  

But even top-tier, single-platform management solutions don't solve for:

- Multiple annual contract renewals  
- Complex licensing  
- Expensive training for teams on various solutions  
- Hiring separate teams for each  
- Scattered device data  
- Difficulty managing device compliance and audits  

You can mitigate this risk if you're currently using multiple solutions for managing devices (e.g., Jamf for this, Intune for that, Omnissa for everything else) by consolidating onto **Fleet**.

## Help is on the way

- Use zero-touch deployment methods like **Apple ADE** and **Microsoft Autopilot**  
- Create as many **Teams** as you need for each security baseline in your organization  
- Deploy and automatically patch software on all platforms with no additional integrations  
- Track vulnerability, compliance, and remediation — all in one place  
- Send lock and wipe commands to Apple, Linux, or Windows devices  

At Fleet, we believe we can help by simplifying things:  

Host Fleet anywhere yourself, or we can host it for you. Improve how you manage the device enrollment lifecycle in a single console.  

Use Fleet's simple, clean UI, or manage Fleet with configuration as code in version control.
