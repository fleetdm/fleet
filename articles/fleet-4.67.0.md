Fleet 4.67.0 is now available. See the complete [changelog](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/releases/tag/fleet-v4.67.0) or read on for highlights. For upgrade instructions, visit the [upgrade guide](https://fleetdm.com/docs/deploying/upgrading-fleet) in the Fleet docs.

## Highlights

- Foreign vitals
- Policy targets
- Cancel activities

### Foreign vitals

Fleet now pulls end user details from your identity provider (IdP)—like IdP email, full name, and group memberships—into host vitals. This makes it easier to identify who is using each host to speed up troubleshooting and audits. Learn more [here](https://fleetdm.com/guides/foreign-vitals-map-idp-users-to-hosts).

### Policy targets

Security engineers can now target policies to specific hosts using labels. This gives teams more precise control over enforcement within a [Fleet team](https://fleetdm.com/guides/teams), helping apply the right checks to the right hosts.


### Cancel activities

IT admins can now cancel activities—like software installs or scripts—before they run. This helps correct mistakes or reprioritize tasks without waiting for actions to complete.
