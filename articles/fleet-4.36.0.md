## Highlights

* Merging scheduled and saved queries for enhanced usability


### Merging scheduled and saved queries for enhanced usability

In Fleet 4.36.0, we have aligned the functionality of scheduled queries with saved queries, reflecting our commitment to ðŸŸ¢ Results and ðŸ”µ Objectivity. [Scheduled queries](https://fleetdm.com/docs/get-started/faq#what-happened-to-the-schedule-page) have been merged with saved queries, allowing users to create a query and schedule it at specific intervals or save it for ad-hoc use. As part of the migration, scheduled queries will be copied to each team, and timestamps will be added to query names to prevent naming conflicts. This change aims to enhance usability and configurability by treating queries in the same manner as policies, with team-by-team management.

In line with our values of ðŸŸ£ Openness and simplicity, we are also moving towards deprecating the concept of packs, as the new merged query concept has rendered them unnecessary. The main advantages of these changes are the streamlined user interface for query management, increased flexibility in query configurations, and the ability to manage queries on a team-by-team basis. By making Fleet easier to navigate, we are looking to support our users in achieving their goals while fostering a culture of continual improvement.

## New features, improvements, and bug fixes

* Added the `fleetctl upgrade-packs` command to migrate 2017 packs to the new combined schedule and query concept.
* Updated `fleetctl convert` to convert packs to the new combined schedule and query format.
