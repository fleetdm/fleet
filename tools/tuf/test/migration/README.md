# `migration_test.sh`

This script is used to test the migration from one local TUF repository to a new local TUF repository (with new roots).

> Currently supports running on macOS only.

The script is interactive and assumes the user will use a Windows and Ubuntu VM to install fleetd and test the changes on those platforms too.

- `FLEET_URL`: The Fleet server will be hosted on https://localhost:8080, tunneled via ngrok to e.g. https://s123ssfsdgsdf.ngrok.app.
- `OLD_TUF_URL`: The "old" TUF will be hosted on http://localhost:8081, tunneled via ngrok to e.g. https://121e9b4a4dab.ngrok.app.
- `NEW_TUF_URL`: The "new" TUF will be hosted on http://localhost:8082, tunneled via ngrok to e.g. https://12oe8b5b3cc6.ngrok.app.
- `SIMULATE_NEW_TUF_OUTAGE=1`: Simulates an outage of the new TUF server during the migration.
- `ORBIT_PATCH_IN_OLD_TUF=1`: Simulates an outage of the new TUF server during the migration and a "need" to patch orbit on the old repository.
- `HOSTNAMES`: Space separated list of hostname where fleetd will be installed to test the migration (as reported by osquery/Fleet).
- `NO_TEAM_ENROLL_SECRET`: Enroll secret of "No team" on your Fleet instance.
