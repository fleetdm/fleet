## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) installed and authenticated
```
gh auth login
gh auth refresh -s project # This will give gh project access which is not included by default
```
- Go 1.24+ for building from source

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet.git
cd fleet/tools/github-manage

# Build the tool
go build -o gm cmd/gm/*.go
# or
make

# Make it executable (optional - add to PATH)
chmod +x gm
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Search for issues
./gm issues --search "is:open label:bug"

# View project items
./gm project 58 --limit 50
# Don't know your project number off the top of your head?
# There are some easy to use aliases defined in pkg/ghapi/project.go in `Aliases`

# View estimated tickets
./gm estimated mdm --limit 25

# Pre-sprint report for one or more teams
# Single team (alias or project id)
./gm pre-sprint report mdm
# Multiple teams (comma-separated)
./gm pre-sprint report mdm,soft --limit 1000

# CSV format for spreadsheet use (outputs values per team in provided order)
./gm pre-sprint report mdm,soft --format csv

# Engineering KPIs (reproduces website/scripts/get-bug-and-pr-report.js)
./gm kpi eng                       # human-readable report + CSV row for the KPI sheet
./gm kpi eng --format csv          # just the 6-column CSV row to paste into the sheet
./gm kpi eng --format json         # machine-readable
./gm kpi eng --no-commit-to-merge  # skip per-PR commit fetches (much faster)
```
