# This docker-compose file will set up Elastic APM, Kibana and Elasticsearch containers
# and the apm-server.yml configuration file ensures that APM can talk to Kibana. Once
# the servers are up and running you should be able to browse http://localhost:5601
# and see Kibana running.
# In order to set up the APM dashboards, you will need to run the `./apm-server -setup`
# command on the running apm-server container:
# $ docker-compose up -d
#   Starting elasticsearch_1 ... done
#   Starting kibana_1 ... done
#   Starting apm-server_1 ... done
# $ docker-compose exec apm-server ./apm-server setup
#   Loaded index template
#   Loaded dashboards
#
# You should now be able to browse http://localhost:5601 and see the APM dashboards in Kibana.
