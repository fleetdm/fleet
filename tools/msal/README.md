# MSAL sample app

This is a sample Objective-C application to retrieve Entra's "Device ID" as documented by Microsoft.
We found a way to retrieve this information with osquery via detail queries (using `certificates` and `keychain_items` tables).
We are keeping this here for future reference in case we need to iterate the detail queries.
