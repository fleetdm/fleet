## Hello! Welcome to Fleet's osquery tables documentation.

This file contains additional documentation that we add on top of the existing documentation for osquery.

The existing documentation data lives in the osquery repo at: https://github.com/osquery/osquery-site/tree/source/src/data/osquery_schema_versions.

You can open PRs against either this file or the osquery schema file. Just note that the data in this file overwrites the osquery data whenever there is a conflict.
