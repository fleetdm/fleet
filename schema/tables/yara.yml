examples: |-
  Look for files under `/root` that match a Yara signature. This example uses the [EICAR test file](https://www.eicar.org/download-anti-malware-testfile/).

  ```
  SELECT * FROM yara WHERE path like '/root/%%' AND sigrule IN (
    'rule eicar {
    strings:
    $s1 = "X5O!P%@AP[4\\PZX54(P^)7CC)7}$EICAR-STANDARD-ANTIVIRUS-TEST-FILE!$H+H*" fullword ascii
    condition:
    all of them
  }'
   ) AND matches='eicar';
  ```
