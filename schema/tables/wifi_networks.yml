name: wifi_networks
examples: >-
  Find WiFi networks configured on Macs that are unencrypted and require a
  captive portal. This can be useful to understand how much people use laptops
  in hotels, airports and other environments, and is a good indicator that tools
  such as DNS-over-HTTPS would improve privacy of connectivity.

  ```

  SELECT network_name FROM wifi_networks WHERE security_type='Open' AND captive_portal='1';

  ```
