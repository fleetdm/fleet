name: docker_container_labels
examples: |-
  This table exposes all Docker labels on running containers. By joining it to
  the [docker_containers](https://fleetdm.com/tables/docker_containers)table, we
  can list containers and their maintainers.

  ```
  SELECT dl.value, dc.name, FROM docker_container_labels dl JOIN docker_containers dc ON dl.id = dc.id WHERE key='maintainer';
  ```
