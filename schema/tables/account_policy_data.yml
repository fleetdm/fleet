name: account_policy_data
description: Additional macOS user account data from the AccountPolicy section of [OpenDirectory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Open_Directory), the identity provider used by Apple.
columns:
  - name: uid
    description: "[User ID](https://superuser.com/a/1108201)"
    type: BIGINT
    required: false
notes: >-
  - The values in this OpenDirectory table are related to account creation.  In the past, it was fairly common to use OpenDirectory to have a home folder (`~`) on a server, and then log in and get that folder wherever they are.  (These days, this use case is more uncommon.)
  
  - To determine who is logged in to the Mac, or for example, to check the record name versus the computer's "short name", consider using the data in [the DSCL table](https://fleetdm.com/tables/dscl).
examples: >-
  Query the creation date of user accounts. You could also query the date of the
  last failed login attempt or password change.

  ```

  SELECT strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S',creation_time,'unixepoch') AS creationdate FROM account_policy_data;

  ```


  See each user's last password set date and number of failed logins since last successful login to detect any intrusion attempts.

  ```

  SELECT u.username u.uid, strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S', a.password_last_set_time, 'unixepoch') AS password_last_set_time, a.failed_login_count, strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S', a.failed_login_timestamp, 'unixepoch') AS failed_login_timestamp FROM account_policy_data AS a CROSS JOIN users AS u USING (uid) ORDER BY password_last_set_time ASC;

  ```
