  Identify Macs that contain certificates related to Apple application signing
  and notarization. (replace with your Apple Developer ID string)

  ```
  SELECT * FROM keychain_items WHERE label LIKE '%8EHZ83LZNU%';
  ```
notes: |-
  - This table should be used sparingly as it uses an Apple API which occasionally corrupts the underlying certificate. Learn more [here](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/issues/13065#issuecomment-1658849614).
