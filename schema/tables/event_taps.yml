name: event_taps
examples: |-
  Identify processes that have a tap into the system, such as access to
  keystrokes, and view details on the executable including signature status,
  team identifier if signed and the authority that emitted the signing
  certificate. This can be used to detect keyloggers and other malicious
  applications.

  ```
  SELECT t.event_tapped, s.identifier, s.signed, s.team_identifier, s.authority FROM event_taps t JOIN processes p ON p.pid = t.tapping_process JOIN signature s on s.path = p.path WHERE s.identifier !='com.apple.ViewBridgeAuxiliary' AND s.identifier !='com.apple.universalaccessd' AND s.identifier !='com.apple.accessibility.AXVisualSupportAgent';
  ```
