description: The Windows Registry is a database that stores Windows application data and low-level Windows settings like driver, security, service, system and user information. The `registry` osquery table expresses the data in the Windows Registry.
examples: |- # (optional) string - An example query for this table. Note: This field supports Markdown
  This query returns the date a Windows Host was enrolled in Fleet:

  ```
  SELECT strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S', mtime, 'unixepoch') AS enroll_time FROM registry WHERE path LIKE 'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Enrollments\%%\DeviceEnroller';
  ```

  This query returns the state of the configurable profiles (i.e., domain, public, standard) in the Windows firewall settings (a value of 1 means the firewall is enabled for the profile):

  ```
  WITH profiles AS (
  SELECT SPLIT(KEY, '\', 7) AS enabled,name,data,'profile' AS grpkey
  FROM registry r
  WHERE r.path IN (
  '\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SharedAccess\Parameters\FirewallPolicy\DomainProfile\EnableFirewall', 
  '\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SharedAccess\Parameters\FirewallPolicy\PublicProfile\EnableFirewall',
  '\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SharedAccess\Parameters\FirewallPolicy\StandardProfile\EnableFirewall'
      )
  ),
  firewall AS (
  SELECT
      MAX(CASE WHEN enabled='DomainProfile' THEN DATA END) AS domain_enabled,
      MAX(CASE WHEN enabled='PublicProfile' THEN DATA END) AS public_enabled,
      MAX(CASE WHEN enabled='StandardProfile' THEN DATA END) AS standard_enabled
  FROM profiles
  GROUP BY grpkey
  )
  SELECT *
  FROM firewall;
  ```

  The `registry` table is ideal for use in Fleet policies and queries because of the critical operating system and application data stored in the Windows Registry.
