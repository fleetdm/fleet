name: mdm
notes: |-
  This table is from the [Mac Admins osquery extension](https://github.com/macadmins/osquery-extension).
  
  - Due to changes in macOS 12.3, the output of `profiles show -type enrollment` can only be generated once a day. If you are running this command with another tool, you should set the `PROFILES_SHOW_ENROLLMENT_CACHE_PATH` environment variable to the path you are caching this. The cache file should be `json` with the keys `dep_capable` and `rate_limited present`, both booleans representing whether the device is capable of DEP enrollment and whether the response from `profiles show -type enrollment` is being rate limited or not.
