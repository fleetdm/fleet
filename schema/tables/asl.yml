  Apple System Logger (ASL) is deprecated since macOS 10.12. On older Macs, this
  table can be used to read logs. On newer ones, see the *unified_log* table.
  This example is from the osquery documentation.

  ```
  SELECT time, message FROM asl WHERE facility = 'authpriv' AND sender = 'sudo' AND message LIKE '%python%';
  ```
