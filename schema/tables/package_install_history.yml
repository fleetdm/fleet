  Basic query:

  ```
  SELECT name,package_id,version,source,datetime(time,'unixepoch') AS install_time FROM package_install_history WHERE install_time >= datetime('now','-7 days');

  - Verifying that only approved packages are installed
  - Creating a Fleet policy to receive alerts for any unauthorized or vulnerable installations
