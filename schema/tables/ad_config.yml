  - Active Directory is a directory service used to manage users and computers. A domain is the high level grouping of these objects, which a workstation must join in order to provide the user with features such as Single Sign-On to internal applications using Kerberos. 
 
  - If a host is not bound to an Active Directory domain, then the table returns no results.
