  This table allows you to list PCI devices. With this query, identify devices with a specific model
  ID. This can be useful when trying to identify systems that use common hardware, for example, when
  trying to target firmware updates or understand similarities between problematic systems.

  ```

  SELECT driver, model, vendor, vendor_id FROM pci_devices WHERE model_id='0x1001';

  ```
