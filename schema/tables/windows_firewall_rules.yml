examples: >-
  Controlling inbound access to remote services is essential for maintaining security on a system. This query lists all enabled Windows Firewall rules that allow inbound RDP, WinRM & VNC connections on the public firewall profile.
  
  ```
  
   SELECT name,app_name,local_ports FROM windows_firewall_rules WHERE enabled = 1 AND direction = "In" AND remote_addresses="*" AND profile_public = 1 AND action = "Allow" AND local_ports IN ("3389","5985","5986","5900");
  
  ```
  
notes: >-
  * Just because a rule is enabled doesn't mean that the firewall / firewall profile itself is enabled or active - this would need to be checked elsewhere.
