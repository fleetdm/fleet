description: Configuration files parsed by [augeas](https://augeas.net/).
examples: |-
  This table requires augeas [lenses](https://augeas.net/docs/lenses.html) to be
  installed in their default location. This query will output *sshd_config* as
  if it was a table. This is especially useful to check for specific
  configurations in text files.

  ```
  SELECT * FROM augeas WHERE path='/etc/ssh/sshd_config';
  ```
