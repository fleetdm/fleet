  Replace 1QAZ2WSX with your Apple Developer ID, if you have one. This query
  will then let you identify Macs that have a copy of your code signing and
  notarization certificates.

  ```
  SELECT * FROM certificates WHERE common_"name" LIKE '%%1QAZ2SWX%%';
  ```

notes: |-
  - This table should be used sparingly as it uses an Apple API which occasionally corrupts the underlying certificate. Learn more [here](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/issues/13065#issuecomment-1658849614).
