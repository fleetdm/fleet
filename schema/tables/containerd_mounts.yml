  This table is not a core osquery table. It is included as part of Fleet's agent
  ([fleetd](https://fleetdm.com/docs/get-started/anatomy#fleetd)).
  
  The `containerd_mounts` table is available on Linux systems with containerd installed. It provides
  information about the mounts configured for containers managed by containerd.
  
  This table is useful for systems using containerd as a container runtime, such as those running
  Kubernetes. See the `docker_container_mounts` table for information about mounts in Docker containers.
