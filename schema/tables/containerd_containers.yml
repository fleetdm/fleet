  This table is not a core osquery table. It is included as part of Fleet's agent
  ([fleetd](https://fleetdm.com/docs/get-started/anatomy#fleetd)).
  
  The `containerd` table is available on Linux systems with containerd installed. It provides
  information about the containers managed by containerd, including their state, image, and runtime.
  
  This table is useful for systems using containerd as a container runtime, such as those running
  Kubernetes. See the `docker_containers` table for information about containers managed by Docker.
