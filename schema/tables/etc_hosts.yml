name: etc_hosts
description: The `hosts` file comprises a local, plain-text configuration for mapping IP addresses to host names. It does not necessarily rely on an external Domain Name System (DNS) for routing. The `etc_hosts` osquery table expresses the data in the `hosts` file.
examples: |-
  This query detects if the macOS `/private/etc/hosts` file has been modified from its default state:

  ```
  SELECT * FROM etc_hosts WHERE address != '127.0.0.1' AND address != '::1' AND address != '255.255.255.255';
  ```
notes: |-
  The `hosts` file is customized by many organizations. As part of a defense-in-depth security posture it's important to track `hosts` modifications. Endpoints with a modified `hosts` configuration connected to enterprise networks can potentially bypass network rules, proxies and firewalls or be routed to malicious sites.
  
  File paths to `hosts`:
  - Linux: `/etc/hosts`
  - macOS: `/private/etc/hosts`
  - Windows: `C:\Windows\system32\drivers\etc`
