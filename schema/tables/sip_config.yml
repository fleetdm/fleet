name: sip_config
description: macOS System Integrity Protection (SIP) protects the Mac by preventing the execution of unauthorized code. The `sip_config` osquery table collects the current SIP status of a Mac.
examples: |-
  Basic query:
  
  ```
  SELECT * FROM sip_config;
  ```

  This query displays the current SIP status (SIP is enabled if the value=1):

  ```
  SELECT enabled FROM sip_config WHERE config_flag='sip';
  ```
notes: |-
  SIP:
  - automatically authorizes apps users download from the App Store
  - authorizes apps developers notarize and distribute directly to users
  - prevents launching of other apps unless users or administrators modify "Gatekeeper" settings

  Organizations that develop software for Apple operating systems on the Mac may allow users to disable SIP. Because SIP is a basic and critical macOS security protection it is important to monitor SIP status on Hosts.
