name: dns_cache

  An integral part of incident response is understanding all systems that may have been compromised. To help with this, a query like the following will return positive for a system that has resolved a domain that contains `baddomain`. It's important to note that a system will only cache the DNS mapping for a limited time - see Notes below for further information. 
  
  ```
     
   SELECT name, type FROM dns_cache WHERE name LIKE '%baddomain%';

  ```

    
notes: >-

  This table pulls from the local system's DNS cache. By default, the local DNS cache entry for a domain will be removed once the TTL for the domain has expired. For instance, osquery.io has a TTL of 60 seconds. When this domain has been resolved on a local Windows system, the DNS mapping will expire in 60 seconds from the resolution time - so `SELECT * FROM dns_cache WHERE name = 'osquery.io'` will only return results during that 60 second window.

  Windows has a maximum time that it allows a cache entry to exist- by default, it is 1 day. If the domain has a TTL of greater than 1 day, Windows will still remove the DNS entry from its cache after 1 day.
