name: package_bom
description: The "bill of materials" (`.bom`) file in a macOS installer package (`.pkg`) lists all files installed by the package. The `package_bom` osquery table collects the data from the `.bom` files created in `/private/var/db/receipts` by macOS when a `.pkg` file is executed.
examples: |-
  This query collects the filepath and time of installation for the libVFXCore.dylib (Dynamic Library) file installed as part of Xcode.app:

  ```
  SELECT filepath,modified_time FROM package_bom WHERE path='/private/var/db/receipts/com.apple.pkg.Xcode.bom' AND filepath LIKE '%libVFXCore.dylib';
  ```
notes: |-
  Keeping track of files installed by applications is critical for upholding software management best security practices.
