name: time_machine_backups
examples: >-
  See the time of the latest backup. In environments where you want to encourage
  backups, this can be useful to remind users to perform them, and in
  environments where you do not allow backups, to detect that they are
  happening.

  ```

  SELECT strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S',backup_date,'unixepoch') AS last_backup FROM time_machine_backups;

  ```
