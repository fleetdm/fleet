name: cpu_time
description: The `cpu_time` table displays data from the `/proc/stat` file which records how the Central Processing Unit (CPU) in a computer or mobile device allocates time to processing workloads.
examples: |-
  This query identifies Hosts on which the ratio of CPU time spent processing System workloads compared to User workloads is 2:1. This could be evidence of a corrupted operating system or malicious activity:

  ```
  SELECT * FROM cpu_time WHERE user/system > 2;
  ```

  This query duplicates the macOS Activity Monitor.app GUI which shows the percentage of CPU time spent on System, User and Idle workloads:

  ```
    SELECT printf(ROUND((CAST(SUM(system) AS FLOAT)/(SUM(idle)+SUM(system)+SUM(user)))*100,2)) AS system_pct,
  printf(ROUND((CAST(SUM(user) AS FLOAT)/(SUM(idle)+SUM(system)+SUM(user)))*100,2)) AS user_pct,
  printf(ROUND((CAST(SUM(idle) AS FLOAT)/(SUM(idle)+SUM(system)+SUM(user)))*100,2)) AS idle_pct
  FROM cpu_time;
  ```
