name: safari_extensions
description: Safari extensions add functionality to Safari.app, the native web browser in macOS. The `safari_extensions` table collects all Safari extensions installed on a Mac.
columns:
  - name: uid
examples: |-
  Collect Safari extensions for all Mac users:
  
  ```
  SELECT * FROM users CROSS JOIN safari_extensions USING (uid);
  ```
notes: |-
  Because Safari data is intentionally isolated for each macOS user to maintain privacy, this query requires a `JOIN` operation.
  
  Query explanation:
  
  - The `safari_extensions` table has a row for each installed extension
  - Each row has a column with the `uid` of the user who installed the extension
  - Each `uid` from the `safari_extensions` table is matched in the `users` table to collect Safari extensions in the output data for all user accounts on the Mac by the `JOIN`
