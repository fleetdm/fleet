name: homebrew_packages
examples: >-
  Check the version of a package installed via homebrew. This example checks the
  version of ffmeg, which should be replaced by the actual package you want to
  check for. This is useful for finding problematic or vulnerable installs,
  though Fleet will detect vulnerable packages automatically.

  ```

  SELECT version FROM homebrew_packages WHERE name = 'ffmpeg';

  ```
