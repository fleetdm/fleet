name: ntdomains
examples: |-
  If the system is joined to a domain, this query will return the domain name as well as all known domain controllers and their IP addresses.
  
  ```
  SELECT domain_name, domain_controller_name, domain_controller_address, status FROM ntdomains WHERE domain_name != "";
  ```
    
notes: |-

This table returns a row even if the local system is not joined to a domain - in this case, the `status` column will be `Unknown` and the `name` column will contain `Domain: $Hostname of local system`.
