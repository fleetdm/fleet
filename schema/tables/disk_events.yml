name: disk_events
examples: |-
  This is an evented table, and as such, is more useful if you are sending
  osquery logs to a SIEM or other centralized destination via Fleet. Events must
  be enabled. This query will contain the list of all actions related to
  connecting and removing disks, including SMB drives and USB storage, which can
  be very useful for investigative purposes.

  ```
  SELECT * FROM disk_events;
  ```
