// Profile verification is a set of related processes that run on the Fleet server to ensure that
// the MDM profiles installed on a host are the ones expected by the Fleet server. Expected profiles
// comprise the profiles that belong to the host's assigned team (or no
// team, as applicable).
//
// The Fleet server enqueues commands to install profiles on hosts via the MDM
// protocol. The Fleet server periodically runs a cron that enqueues install profile
// commands for host profiles that do not have a verification status (i.e. status is null).
// Install profile commands may be enqueued as a result of a variety of events, such as when a host
// enrolls in Fleet, when a host's team membership changes, when a new profile is uploaded, when an
// existing profile is modified, or when a failed profile is retried.
//
// Verification status of a host profile can change in the following ways:
//
// - When an install profile command is enqueued by the server, the verification status is set to "pending".
//
// - When the results of an install profile command are reported via the MDM protocol, the Fleet server
//   parses the results and updates the host's verification status for the applicable profile. If the
//   command was acknowledged, the verification status is set to "verifying". If the command resulted
//   in an error, the server determines if the profile should be retried (in which case, a new install profile
//   command will be enqueued by the server) or marked as "failed" and updates the datastore accordingly.
//
// - When host details are reported via osquery, the Fleet server ingests a list of installed
//   profiles and compares the reported profiles with the list of profiles expected to be
//   installed on the host. Expected profiles comprise the profiles that belong to the host's assigned
//   team (or no  team, as applicable). If an expected profile is found, the verification status is
//   set to "verified". If an expected profile is missing from the reported results, the server determines
//   if the profile should be retried (in which case, a new install profile command will be enqueued by the server)
//   or marked as "failed" and updates the datastore accordingly.

// VerifyHostMDMProfiles performs the verification of the MDM profiles installed on a host and
// updates the verification status in the datastore. It is intended to be called by Fleet osquery
// service when the Fleet server ingests host details.
