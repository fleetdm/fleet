Fleet is the most widely used open source osquery manager.  Deploying osquery with Fleet enables programmable live queries, streaming logs, and effective management of osquery across 100,000+ servers, containers, and laptops.  It's especially useful for talking to multiple devices at the same time.


## Try Fleet

#### With [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed:

```bash
# Install the Fleet command-line tool
sudo npm install -g fleetctl
# Run a local demo of the Fleet server
sudo fleetctl preview
```

> Windows users can omit `sudo`, and should run the command in `Cmd`/`PowerShell` as administrators.

The Fleet UI is now available at http://localhost:1337.
