## What's it for?
Organizations like Fastly and Gusto use Fleet for vulnerability reporting, detection engineering, device management (MDM), device health monitoring, posture-based access control, managing unused software licenses, and more.

#### Explore data
To see what kind of data you can use Fleet to gather, check out the [table reference documentation](https://fleetdm.com/tables).

#### Out-of-the-box policies
Fleet includes out-of-the box support for all [CIS benchmarks for macOS and Windows](https://fleetdm.com/docs/using-fleet/cis-benchmarks), as well as many [simpler queries](https://fleetdm.com/queries).

Take as much or as little as you need for your organization.

#### Supported platforms
Here are the platforms Fleet currently supports:

- Linux (all distros)
- macOS
- Windows
- Chromebooks
- Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- Google Cloud (GCP)
- Azure (Microsoft cloud)
- Data centers
- Containers (kube, etc)
- Linux-based IoT devices

## Lighter than air
Fleet is lightweight and modular.  You can use it for security without using it for MDM, and vice versa.  You can turn off features you are not using.

#### Openness
Fleet is dedicated to flexibility, accessibility, and clarity.  We think [everyone can contribute](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company#openness) and that tools should be as easy as possible for everyone to understand.

#### Good neighbors
Fleet has no ambition to replace all of your other tools.  (Though it might replace some, if you want it to.)  Ready-to-use, enterprise-friendly integrations exist for Snowflake, Splunk, GitHub Actions, Vanta, Elastic Jira, Zendesk, and more.

Fleet plays well with Munki, Chef, Puppet, and Ansible, as well as with security tools like Crowdstrike and SentinelOne.  For example, you can use the free version of Fleet to quickly report on what hosts are _actually_ running your EDR agent.

While most folks prefer to use one or the other, Fleet can also coexist peacefully with Rapid7 and other agent-based vulnerability scanners.  This can be useful during migrations.

#### Free as in free
The free version of Fleet will [always be free](https://fleetdm.com/pricing).  Fleet is [independently backed](https://linkedin.com/company/fleetdm) and actively maintained with the help of many amazing [contributors](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/graphs/contributors).

#### Longevity
The [company behind Fleet](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company) is founded (and majority-owned) by [true believers in open source](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company/why-this-way#why-open-source).  The company's business model is influenced by GitLab (NYSE: GTLB), with great investors, happy customers, and the capacity to become profitable at any time.

In keeping with Fleet's value of openness, [Fleet Device Management's company handbook](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company) is public and open source.  You can read about the [history of Fleet and osquery](https://fleetdm.com/handbook/company#history) and our commitment to improving the product.

<!-- > To upgrade from Fleet ≤3.2.0, just follow the upgrading steps for the earliest subsequent major release from this repository (it'll work out of the box until the release of Fleet 5.0). -->


## Is it any good?
Fleet is used in production by IT and security teams with thousands of laptops and servers.  Many deployments support tens of thousands of hosts, and a few large organizations manage deployments as large as 400,000+ hosts.
